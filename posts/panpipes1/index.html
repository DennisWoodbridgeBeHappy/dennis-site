The night after he left that town, he’d watched them flicker out of the sky, one by one. He remembered telling that idiot about it, how happy he’d sounded over the phone. What was his name?</p><p>Then it was the clouds, the grass, the dirt, the towns, the people. Any route back was gone, his belongings, any reminders of ‘home’. A wave of unexplainable nostalgia washed over him, feelings associated with memories he no longer had, a love for a face he no longer carried with him.</p><p>The world plunged into nothingness. No, he simply didn’t have the eyes to see it anymore. He could still feel the ground beneath him, still breathe the air around him. But the ground was flat and constant, unchanging no matter how far forward he proceeded. The air was completely still and stale, the wind left behind days ago.</p><p>Still, he continued onwards.</p><p>His hearing faded shortly after. Of course, it could have been the concept of noise that had vanished but with no hands to reach for his ears, he couldn’t check if he was at fault or not.</p><p>There was that nostalgia again, as though he knew this place somehow. He’d been here bef-</p><p>Oh.</p><p>This was that moment.</p><p>Upon leaving… somewhere. That place was already lost to his mind. It was just ‘the start’. The place before every other place.</p><p>There was fear, so bad it crippled him; bent his knees beneath his weight when ‘it’ had showed him this scene.</p><p>But there was no fear now. No apprehension to stop his legs- No. His legs had long stopped responding to him anyway. And yet the air still hit his face? He was still moving, maybe even picking up speed. Maybe he’d now even lost the ability to stay still.</p><p>But there was no reason for him to stop anyway. What would that accomplish? He must reach ‘it’. That idiot believes he will. Not that he remembered what ‘it’ was. Didn’t even remember why he needed to reach ‘it’. But he wouldn’t stop, even if he could.</p><p>His heart gave out next. He still vaguely remembered that that was bad. That would stop him reaching ‘it’ if he didn’t hurry up. How far away was he now? Could he make it? There was no point in worrying, he couldn’t control his own speed anymore anyway. But the idea of not getting to ‘it’ filled him with… What was it?</p><p>The certainty that had carried him this far was gone. He was sure he remembered remembering ‘it’ telling him he’d get there. But what kind of reassurance was that? Why had he believed so much in that thing anyway?</p><p>was gone now. Everything was. Or everything that he remembered having had was. He was just consciousness, a bundle of emotions and thoughts and , propelled forwards through momentum alone, sustaining itself with memories of memories of memories, certain that even those would only last so much longer. And then what would happen? Would he cease to think? Cease even to question?</p><p>He’d make it. He didn’t know that, he didn’t have to. He’d make it. He believed it. Even if he never got to experience making it, he’d get there. That was the important thing.

The field before him seemed infinite from where he stood. That blue ceiling stretched on forever. But now he knew that wasn’t the case.</p><p>Felix had crossed into the unprotected zone for the first time in his life and there ‘it’ was, waiting for him. The Known. The Truth. The North, the all-powerful, the sateless. Entropy, collapse, the end, knowledge, belief trust love brainheartandbody. God.</p><p>His whole body was shivering. He wouldn’t come back. He would never see Adam again. He’d never get to see Adam smile when they return. But-</p><p>“I make it Adam…”</p><h3 id=adam>Adam<a href=#adam class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><h4 id=just-inside-the-south-gate-0th-parallel-1400-day-0>Just inside the south gate, 0th parallel, 14:00, Day 0<a href=#just-inside-the-south-gate-0th-parallel-1400-day-0 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h4><p>Adam waited patiently with a smile on his face as the man checked over his identification once, twice, three times. The man was clearly used to his job standing about; he couldn’t have had much more muscle than Adam but was well over double the weight with no extra height to show for it. He had a guard’s uniform on, all purples and blues and silvers but the proud markings looked out of place on a man who had so long ago stopped caring for his appearance. His beard was patchy and unkempt; his skin was grey and his teeth yellow and he fixed Adam with an empty stare.</p><p>“Look kid, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don’t look a day over 18. You know I can’t let you out until you turn 20. It’s dangerous.” His voice was soft, almost caring and he slid slightly to his left to better block the gate.</p><p>“I’ve always been told I have a young face. But you’ve got my ID right there, unless you’re saying I faked it?” Adam did his best to look puzzled and slightly irritated; a task that proved rather easy when his fake ID had just been discovered.</p><p>“Kid…” The man sighed and looked down at the ID once more just in case. “It’s well made, it is, if I take it to my boss, he’s gonna tell me to let you through. Honestly, I’m surprised you managed to get your hands on summat like this. If you force my hand, I’m gonna have to let you through, I just wanna be sure you get what you’re asking me.”</p><p>“Felix is probably already through the north gate; I really don’t have the time to waste here.” The guard flinched slightly.</p><p>“Felix huh.” He grimaced slightly and Adam smiled even wider. “… Fine. Creepy kids, the both of you.”</p><p>Adam made to shuffle past him, but the guard stopped him again, grabbing the massive rucksack on his back.</p><p>“Oi, let me finish my job first. You got stuff you need to agree to before leaving.” The guard pulled a short piece of paper out of his back pocket and found the start of the text as Adam rolled his eyes and moved back again. Every second he was held up here, a second less on the road. Tapping his leg could only relieve so much anticipation. “In leaving through this gate, you acknowledge and accept the risk to your own being. Your brain, your heart, and your body are your own, to have, to protect and to maintain. An affected individual will, under no circumstances, be allowed to pass back into the city, nor any allied city. Is this understood?”</p><p>“It is. I understand and accept.” The words left Adam’s mouth almost before the man had finished speaking.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance and the guard hesitated one last time before pushing open the gate and stepping aside. Adam burst out into the cool breeze and took what felt like the first real breath of his life. For the first time, the horizon didn’t end in a towering, grey and brown wall. Instead… ‘The ends of the Earth, mapped out in front of me’.
Adam grinned and turned back to grin at the guard one final time before the gate shut behind him. “Thank you.”</p><p>Adam made his way down a thin path snaking through that eternal field. He hiked for just short of 4 hours before coming to a stop. One look at his watch confirmed what he’d sensed: just north of the 1st parallel south, the edge of the protected zone.</p><p>Somewhere, no more than a few steps a head of him, an invisible barrier stretched out, joining the horizon from east to west. A thousand years of effort, a wall that blocked out the rest of the world, blocked out the Unknown and the Known, the mind, the heart and the body, blocked out the very humanity from the humans that lived inside it. The final barrier between him and reality.</p><p>One step. Two. Three, fo-</p><p>He collapsed to the floor.</p><p>The wall wasn’t a physical thing, he hadn’t felt it as he passed through, but he knew. Some part of him could tell, it was behind him now and every fibre of his being was living and free for the first time. His body moved of its own accord; his limbs unused to the immense well of energy that flowed through them struggled to remain still, jerking uncontrollably. His mind raced with thoughts beyond his control, thoughts he had never dared think before, thoughts he couldn’t think before. And his heart… It was like feeling for the first time. Love, fear, anger, joy, all the categories his emotions had fit into his entire life vanished in an instant and he knew they had always been meaningless. The heart, his heart, because that’s what it finally was, was a mess of wants and desires and needs and that was how it should be.</p><p>He cried there, his forehead in the dirt, unable to stand, unable to even right himself. He cried for so long he lost track. But when his body finally listened settled, his energy drained, and he managed to sit up and look at the world, to truly experience for the first time… It was beautiful.</p><p>The night cast a moody shadow over eternity, the wind felt icy on his face, the grass was like blades in his palms and the sky… The night sky. The stars had never looked like that in town. They twinkled so bright it looked like they might consume the blackness of space itself. It was intoxicating, freedom. And terrifying. To be able to go anywhere, do anything, to stain this beautiful world in his own colours. Everything had never seemed so big.</p><p>“To change to your convenience.”</p><p>“To perfect as your duty.”</p><p>“To experience for your enjoyment.”</p><p>Three figures loomed over him. Not humans, very clearly something… Else. But he couldn’t pinpoint a name. In the first place they were all far too different from one another to all be one ‘thing’.</p><p>The first, a hulking mass of metal and glass, almost double his height, bent down. Adam flinched back slightly but stopped when a massive steel hand landed on his chest. It stayed there, as though waiting, calmly hovering over his heart and the twin cameras in its head watched him intently.</p><p>The second, a man, covered in a very loose white cloth that hung from his shoulders to his ankles, kept in place only by a golden belt at his waist, grasped Adam’s hands in his. Or, tried to; the man’s hands passed through Adam’s skin and the man had to readjust to feign contact. His features were sculpted, his muscle lean but strong underneath the toga, his eyes brighter than the sun.</p><p>The third, a monster of approximately human shape but with the face and legs of a goat. His five fingers and thumb grasped Adam’s head lightly and turned him to face it. Its arms were too long, and its exposed torso was a mess of muscle and hair. That hand could crush his skull in an instant and Adam wouldn’t be able to do a thing.</p><p>“Together,” the monster started. “We’re going to have a lot of fun.”</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/dennis-site/posts/nrpg2/ class="button inline next">[<span class=button__text>NRPG v2.0</span>] ></a></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
