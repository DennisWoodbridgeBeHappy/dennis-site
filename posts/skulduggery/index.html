This dynamic results in LITERALLY all of the most interesting moments of the Skulduggery series. The contradiction between her own ego and the need to stop Argeddion in Book 7 (before they ruined Argeddion’s character, discussed later) is the reason I think book 7 is the best installment in the series to this point. Everything Valkyrie does throughout the series makes sense given her situation as she grows more and more full of herself the more times she saves the world. Similarly, the drama that results from her realisation that she is Darquesse (the one prophesied to destroy the world) and the subsequent actions she takes as well as her talks with Skulduggery are my favourite moments in the series. Derek Landy portrays her fear, her weakness and her self-hatred in the face of realising the flaws in her self image amazingly.</p><p>Skulduggery on the other hand is her natural compliment, he’s her mentor and he’s gone through basically everything she goes through in the series (though much of that we don’t find out until later). His trauma at losing his family, his time as Lord Vile (evil alter ego) and his own romance with China Sorrows each very nicely parallel Valkyrie’s fear of killing her family, her fear of becoming Darquesse and her relationships in the series. It’s mentioned throughout the series that Valkyrie is captivated with Skulduggery and I agree with that assessment, he’s a very dangerous man, despite how he shows himself and, from a very young age, Valkyrie, knowingly or otherwise, clearly modeled herself after him, even inheriting his character flaws (for example, it is through killing her family that Darquesse manages to beat Valkyrie in Book 9, much as Nefarian Serpine once killed Skulduggery’s family to shake him, resulting in Skulduggery’s initial death). Every interaction between these two characters feels very natural.</p><p>I think that the relationship between the two main characters as well as how Derek Landy showcases Skulduggery’s grief and Valkyrie’s self-doubt are easily the best parts of the series. Unfortunately, I think this is also where my love for the series ends.</p><h2 id=characters--relationships>Characters & Relationships<a href=#characters--relationships class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Here I’ll briefly discuss a variety of characters that I think are indicative of broader issues within the series.</p><h3 id=scapegrace>Scapegrace<a href=#scapegrace class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>I like Scapegrace, even if he’s constantly shifting personality and goals, I think he’s a fun character. However, later in the series, a doctor puts his brain in a woman&rsquo;s body, resulting in, not only him both feeling and expressing feelings of dysmorphia but also him being treated as a sex object by the men around him (including some of our heroes) for multiple books worth of time. This is treated as a joke for the duration. I do not support this.</p><h3 id=vampires>Vampires<a href=#vampires class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Throughout the early part of the series Derek Landy makes it obvious over and over and over that Vampires are not people and, whilst capable of thought, they feel emotion much more strongly than humans do. They become obsessed easily and hold incredibly long grudges and they’re incapable of long standing relationships. This is brought to a head when, after a year of increasingly desperate attempts to seduce her, Caelan attacks and attempts to kill Valkyrie for turning down his advances. This is a very clear nod to the reader that, past this point we should never trust a Vampire in the series. Every side character Vampire has done something similar and, in treating Caelan as though he were different, Valkyrie puts herself and her family in great danger.</p><p>Then in the final books, Vampires are relied upon multiple times by some of the smartest and most resourceful characters in the series. Silly. Incredibly silly.
It should also be noted that the power level of Vampires sways vastly throughout the series. Introduced as “the most effective killing machine on Earth”, it takes Valkyrie just two years of magic training to survive a 15 v 1. Then, in the final book of the saga, a similar number of Vampires are able to delay Darquesse, someone who is, at this point, essentially a God. Inconsistencies like this are rather common.</p><h3 id=argeddion>Argeddion<a href=#argeddion class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Argeddion was my favourite villain of the series, until he wasn’t. Having a pacifist as a villain was fun and an interesting idea and, while it lasted, I very much enjoyed his character. He was an idealist that had stepped too far from reality and his actions, though well intentioned, were going to cause world wide suffering. That is an incredibly cool moral tangle for our heroes to have to work through.</p><p>Then about half way through the book he starts killing people en masse because Derek Landy couldn’t find a different way to make him seem villainous. This annoyed me greatly.</p><h3 id=stephanie--fletcher>Stephanie & Fletcher<a href=#stephanie--fletcher class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Backstory: Stephanie is Valkyrie’s reflection come to life, she attempts to take over Valkyrie’s life at one point and kills Valkyrie’s cousin. Fletcher is Valkyrie’s ex-boyfriend.</p><p>Fletcher dating Stephanie makes literally no sense and I fucking hate it, it’s grose. Can you imagine coming back after an immensely traumatic experience (Valkyrie had been possessed by Darquesse for a few weeks whilst this happened) and finding out your ex boyfriend is dating your fucking reflection??? Not only that but the reflection who killed your cousin and attempted to steal your life? And he knew that when he got with her? Fletcher consistently makes bad relationship choices throughout the series so you could argue it’s in character but this kind of lack of care for Valkyrie’s feelings is directly contradictory to everything we know about him. It’s insane. And everyone around him treats it like it’s just a little weird and not like, yk, an immensely creepy thing to do and a massive overstep morally.</p><p>Then, as the final act of ultimate bm, Derek Landy makes Stephanie die whilst listening to Fletcher confess to Valkyrie he’s only with Stephanie cause he isn’t over Valkyrie yet????????? There was literally no fucking need for this (there was a much nicer resolution for Stephanie set up as described below), he just wrote it because he’s an evil, evil man.</p><p>Furthermore, Stephanie, whilst she could be an incredible plot point has incredibly inconsistent character development. She goes from “I’m willing to kill my cousin to charge a super weapon to kill my real self and take over her life” to “I just want my family to be happy and safe” in like 50 pages for literally no reason.</p><p>Finally, in the last book, there’s a plot point that requires “a soul, freely given” to save the world. This is clearly a chance for Stephanie, who has been on a 9 book journey to prove that she’s human and not just Valkyrie’s reflection, to prove she has changed and just wants to protect her family. She can give up her life, proving she has a soul and proving she’s good in one fell swoop, it is a PERFECT role for her and it solves a lot of problems going forwards. Instead she is killed by Darquesse because Darquesse needs a body that isn’t Valkyrie’s cause otherwise Valkyrie can’t have her cool moment where she develops a whole new kind of magic (which makes absolutely no sense, even in context, discussed further later). It is a waste of 9 books worth of build up for literally no reason and it makes me question if Derek Landy thought about the plot points he set up at all.</p><h3 id=the-black-cleaver>The Black Cleaver<a href=#the-black-cleaver class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>The Black Cleaver dies in a fight with Tanith (see Sanguine & Tanith) in the final book, 6 years after he nearly killed her in their first fight. It’s supposed to be poetic that her final act in the series is to beat the first enemy that ever beat her but it’s undermined by the stupidity of the encounter. Three things are necessary for Tanith’s win and they are all remarkably silly:</p><p>● Cutting off the head of a Zombie kills them. This is supposedly true despite the most notable Zombie in the series, Vaurien Scapegrace, having spent MULTIPLE BOOKS alive as just a head.</p><p>● Cleavers have a tradition of fighting in a ring naked to test their strength against one another. This is never mentioned prior to book 9 and is one of like three things we actually know about Cleavers. It is CLEARLY introduced exclusively as a way to get the Black Cleaver out of his defensive clothing and thus give Tanith a fighting chance.</p><p>● The Black Cleaver still follows Cleaver rules despite being loyal to a Necromancer. This is never foreshadowed nor even hinted at, the Black Cleaver has attacked the Sanctuary (the place the Cleavers are supposed to defend) MULTIPLE TIMES, there was no reason for Tanith to believe this was the case because it literally isn’t the case. And yet the Black Cleaver follows the rules of Cleaver combat whilst in the ring.</p><p>The Black Cleaver also spends months working for the leader of the Sanctuary at one point even though his loyalty is supposed to be exclusively to Necromancers for seemingly no reason, even when there was a Necromancer around that could’ve taken control of him at any point. There are a number of other such inconsistencies with this character which I won’t mention as listing every inconsistency with every long standing character would be a very long task.</p><h3 id=sanguine--tanith>Sanguine & Tanith<a href=#sanguine--tanith class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Backstory: Tanith was a good guy but was taken over by a remnant (think ghost) for 3 years, during which time she was in a long standing relationship with Sanguine, a bad guy. Towards the very end of the series, she is unpossessed and completely missing 5 books worth of context about wtf is going on.</p><p>Sanguine dies fighting the Black Cleaver to protect Tanith like 3 chapters before Tanith solos the Black Cleaver. The author wanted Sanguine dead for seemingly no reason and didn’t care how it happened. This is one of many moments in the series that could’ve been written even slightly better to improve the vibe immensely.</p><p>At this point in the story, Sanguine has reluctantly helped the heroes a number of times because of his love for Tanith (ghost Tanith retains human Tanith’s memories and thus likes to play at being a good guy sometimes even though she supports Darquesse who is supposed to end the world) and Tanith has just been released from a possession that’s lasted more than 3 years, learnt the person she loves has died and that she’s spent the last 3 years in a relationship with Sanguine.</p><p>Having them fight together in this moment and finally beat an enemy that bested Tanith years ago at the cost of Sanguine’s life could be a fantastic character moment for both of them. Sanguine would get to finally do a selfless deed and prove to Tanith that he truly loves her. Tanith would finally get to beat her long standing enemy with the help of someone she has an immensely complicated relationship with and, in the space of just a few days, would have lost TWO lovers. This moment could’ve made the book for me and it would still have the exact same consequences as what Derek wrote.</p><p>Instead, Sanguine dies after confidently attempting to rescue and Tanith doesn’t give a shit. Then Tanith wins a battle she had no right to win because of a plot point the reader didn’t know about until 50 pages ago. This is the shit I mean when I say Skulduggery Pleasant fails on its promises. It introduces potentially amazing scenes, locations and plot points and over and over again it squanders them or refuses to explore them at all.</p><h3 id=darquesse>Darquesse<a href=#darquesse class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Throughout the entire 9th book Darquesse is treated as a giga ultimate threat the likes of which we’ve never seen before and she’s definitely gonna kill a major character. This is stupid and silly. At this point, Darquesse has appeared in the last 4 books and has been beaten in 3 of them. True to form, she doesn’t manage to kill any major characters in the final book either.</p><p>They reveal MULTIPLE macguffins in book 9 that were previously unheard of throughout the series to beat her and each one fails because of mistakes Valkyrie makes. The most powerful weapon in the series can’t be used because Stephanie misplaced it. Darquesse gets two immense power ups in book 9 because:</p><p>● The heroes forgot to guard the one guy in the series that is stronger than her</p><p>● The Remnants (like ghosts, they possess people) all decided it’s a good idea to all rush into her mouth to try to possess her AFTER she has shown multiple times she’s able to eat Remnants and get a power boost from it</p><p>This results in a book 9 that feels not like our heroes are failing against an overwhelmingly powerful enemy but like our heroes are incapable of making a good decision and are allowing Darquesse to become the threat she was prophesied to be.</p><p>For 6 books, Derek Landy tries and fails to come up with an actual motivation for Darquesse to destroy the world. There’s also a moment in book 9, just before Darquesse gets forced out of Valkyrie’s body, where we literally listen to her thoughts and she says she secretly just wants human connection and she doesn’t intend to kill everyone anymore. In the end, her motivation to kill everyone is basically “she’s mad they don’t trust her after she killed a bunch of other people she had no real motivation to kill”. It’s deeply unsatisfying.</p><p>Finally, the way they get rid of her (despite having multiple clear and easy shots to kill her, discussed more later) is to trick her into thinking she killed everyone and open a portal into another dimension to fight the Faceless Ones (discussed later). They do this by putting her into a dream where she kills everyone and conquers our universe. At the end of this dream she returns to earth and then, bored, opens a portal to the Faceless Ones (evil gods, discussed later). They brought her back to the real world as she opened this portal (resulting in her opening the portal in reality, something she shouldn’t be capable of but whatever), thus trapping herself in a world of angry gods she has no hope of killing at this point. This resolves nothing, it doesn’t bring any themes to a conclusion, it certainly isn’t poetic, it relies on:</p><ol><li>Powers we’ve never seen before from characters who haven’t been important until right now and,</li><li>The Faceless Ones, an enemy that’s been forgotten about since book fucking 4.</li></ol><p>It’s like Derek Landy went out of his way to find the single least satisfying ending to his story.</p><h2 id=the-magic-system>The magic system<a href=#the-magic-system class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><h3 id=trade-offs>Trade offs<a href=#trade-offs class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>The first of many things that Derek Landy forgets about his magic system is established incredibly early on, within just 3 chapters of the first book. That is; all magic has a trade off. We see this early on as the first enemy of the series (who had made himself invulnerable to fire) dissolves into water and dies. The idea here, obviously, being that opposing elements counteract one another and thus resistance to magic in one field makes you equivalently weak to magic in the opposing field. Neither this, nor anything remotely resembling this rule is ever used again, not even in the same book (I had originally assumed this was establishing a rule that would help them fight off the big bad of book 1 but even this wasn’t the case). As a result, we simply have one idiot who didn’t know literally the first rule of magic Valkyrie is ever taught working for our big bad. Though, of course, I can’t fault him as this rule seemingly never exists after this moment. It’s an unsatisfying start to an unsatisfying series.</p><h3 id=elementals>Elementals<a href=#elementals class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>It’s clear, as described above, that Derek Landy didn’t really have his magic system completely ironed out when he started writing and I believe that this is perfectly fine, especially for a new author. Unfortunately, however, he makes no attempt to rectify past mistakes and, throughout the remainder of the series, consistently introduces new information about the magic system that contradicts the reader’s prior understanding. For our first example, we’ll look at Elementals, what we are led to believe is the most common type of sorcerer.</p><p>When the series begins, each elemental discipline is incredibly limited in what it can do. Fire magic creates a throwable ball of fire, wind magic pushes against the air, water magic uhhh, we never really get an explanation for that one, and earth magic seals you in a rock prison which is invulnerable to all attacks but that you cannot willingly leave (you leave at a supposedly random time between a couple months and several decades). There’s a few exceptions which are brought up early: Billy Ray Sanguines earth magic for example allows travel through solid objects and the very first enemy of the series is invulnerable to fire magic (something I have to assume is due to his fire magic affinity as he is confirmed to be an Elemental). For the most part, I’m fine with these as they’re treated as either the result of arduous training or a natural affinity for magic that other people lack, explaining why most Elementals can’t do this (ignore that Skulduggery learnt how to move through walls in an afternoon later in the series).</p><p>I’m more at issue with the progress we see in book 4 Skullduggery. In book 4, Skullduggery returns from the world of the Faceless Ones (discussed later) able to now fly and shoot fire like a flamethrower. This is after 1 year of training; Skulduggery is 400 years old, many other Elementals are of a similar age and have never accomplished either of these feats. We are never given an explanation as to how Skulduggery managed this outside of “1 year of constant training is a long time”. As far as we know, Skulduggery is the only person in the world to ever manage this and every person who sees him do it is shocked it’s even possible. This is remarkably silly given the time frames involved, especially since, even with Skulduggery to train them, no Elemental manages to learn these techniques for the next 3 years (until the end of book 9).</p><h3 id=future-sight>Future Sight<a href=#future-sight class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Mediums are used many many times over the course of the series to predict the future and this is the part of Skulduggery that I dislike the most. Every single prophecy made during Skulduggery is so wildly wrong, so completely off base that not a single thing ever stated in them comes true (except for the final prophecy). Derek Landy explains many times throughout the series that “knowing the future changes the future” and I agree with that but he uses this excuse to:</p><p>● Point at futures that could never possibly happen and,</p><p>● Cover up mistakes in previous prophecies by introducing new prophecies that account for factors that the viewer didn’t know at the time of the last prophecy but that were very much still in play</p><p>This reduces prophecies from “actual future sight that gives an indication of where the world is heading” to “a plot device used to point out who the current big bad is supposed to be”. The prophecies throughout the series serve as a constant reminder that magic doesn’t serve an actual narrative purpose other than making sure what Derek Landy wants to happen happens (see how every time a sorcerer fights a non sorcerer, they seem to forget they can literally just cast magic or how Darquesse doesn’t just turn everyone to dust even though she literally shows she can do that several times throughout the series). This is increasingly frustrating the further on the series goes as the false prophecies pile up.</p><p>Despite this, throughout the entire series, everytime a prophecy occurs, characters take it completely seriously, going so far as to remove weapons that would provide them an edge in combat because “they wore it in the prophecy”. On multiple occasions, this leads to losses on the side of our heroes that were entirely avoidable including, in the final book, the following sequence of events:</p><p>● Valkyrie sees in a prophecy that she is wearing a glove during the final fight with Darquesse</p><p>● Valkyrie is given the glove and finds out it’s ability instantly kills anyone she touches whilst wearing it</p><p>● Valkyrie chooses NOT to wear the glove because she loses against Darquesse whilst wearing it in the prophecy</p><p>● Valkyrie FISTFIGHTS Darquesse and loses after landing what would have been an uncountable number of killing blows were she wearing the fucking glove</p><p>● They then also trap Darquesse in a dream state where she can’t move her actual body and send her to another dimension rather than using the fucking glove on the defenceless sociopath</p><p>This is immensely unsatisfying. Derek Landy clearly wrote himself into a corner and, instead of revising his work even once, sent out a first draft with comically large plot holes.</p><h3 id=names-true-names-and-differing-personalities>Names, True names and differing personalities<a href=#names-true-names-and-differing-personalities class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Names are a very important thing in Skulduggery Pleasant and this is outlined very early on. Each person has three names, as described below:</p><p>● Given name: The name your parents give you at birth. Prior to choosing a name, any sorcerer, no matter their discipline, can use this name to control your every action</p><p>● Chosen name: A name you yourself choose to protect your given name</p><p>● True name: A name that describes your true self, this isn’t chosen by anyone but is intrinsic to your very being. Finding out your true name is borderline impossible for most people. Finding out your true name allows you access to an immense amount of power but if anyone else finds out your true name they can control you completely even if you have chosen a name.</p><p>It should also be noted that you can protect your true name from misuse through carving 3 symbols on your heart (this isn’t really explained but it relates to a gripe I have later).</p><p>Now, let’s think about these things in the context. Every person has a given name, including non sorcerers and non sorcerers don’t choose a name in most circumstances, this means that any sorcerer should be able to completely control any non sorcerer without any issue provided they know their given name. Not a single big bad uses this throughout the entire series, even when they’ve been shown to do worse things and when they need something from a non sorcerer. You might argue “maybe it doesn’t work on non sorcerers” but it is explained over and over again throughout the series that there’s no difference between sorcerers and non sorcerers other than the awareness that magic exists. There are some non sorcerers who can’t use magic even if they know it exists but there is only one confirmed case of this throughout the whole series (Valkyrie’s uncle Gordon). It is also stated in book 1 that the Book of Names contains the true, given and (where applicable) chosen names of all living people. The idea that every living person has the same three name structure but non sorcerers alone are somehow immune to the control aspect is ridiculous. This oversight makes most interactions between villains and non sorcerers intolerably silly.</p><p>My second gripe is to do with what I stated previously about sealing a true name. Sealing a true name requires a physical procedure, it would be relatively straightforward to assume, based on this, that your true name is linked to your body in some way. Late in the series however, we see Darquesse separated from her body and even in the bodies of others. Throughout this, however, no one uses her true name against her. It can be implied then that, even though there is no connection between Darquesse and her actual body, the procedure on Darquesse’s heart still somehow protects her. This makes no sense intuitively. It’s not an actual plot hole but it’s indicative of a lack of thought on the author&rsquo;s part that this is never even addressed.</p><h3 id=specialisation-and-the-surge>Specialisation and the Surge<a href=#specialisation-and-the-surge class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>It’s stated many times throughout the series that, sometime roughly between 18 and 21 (it changes multiple times so I’m just going to assume it differs per person) a sorcerer undergoes the Surge. This vastly improves their magic but locks them into the type of magic they’re best at when the Surge occurs. It’s not unheard of that a Sorcerer changes discipline after their Surge but it’s very uncommon (the only example we have of this happening is Skulduggery but we’ll get to that).</p><p>When Valkyrie undergoes her Surge however, she, for literally no reason, unlocks a completely unheard of type of magic that has nothing to do with either Elemental or Necromancy magic (the types she has actually trained in). This is remarkably silly and completely without explanation. It is used simply to give her a way to fight back against Darquesse after she loses her magic and is a very frustrating plot device.</p><p>Returning to Skulduggery however, he is used in the series as an example of someone who switched discipline after their Surge, switching from Necromancy to Elemental. We learn later on however, he actually never did this and can use Necromancy and Elemental magic even after his Surge, he simply chooses not to use Necromancy particularly often. There is never an explanation given as to why he’s special.</p><h3 id=the-god-killer-weapons>The God Killer Weapons<a href=#the-god-killer-weapons class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>The Sceptre of the Ancients is originally introduced as the only God Killer weapon and is treated as a myth even though, later in the series, we find out there are at least six more God Killer weapons that everyone knew about the whole time. The Sceptre is originally supposed to be immensely hard to use too because it kills with a thought but by the end of the series anyone can pick it up and instantly have perfect control. The other God Killer weapons are also manufactured in a completely separate way to the Sceptre for some inexplicable reason - I imagine it was because the production process for the Sceptre necessitates blood of the ancient ones (thus making Valkyrie, as a direct descendant of the last of the ancients, important in book 1) but this became an annoying restriction by the time the other God Killers were introduced so Derek simply made them work differently; another example of magic simply being a means to an end.</p><h2 id=locations>Locations<a href=#locations class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><h3 id=the-caves>The caves<a href=#the-caves class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>The caves underneath Gordon’s house are a crazy weird place to mention exist and then never properly explore. We know an immense amount of the unexplainable stuff in the series come from there (the Godkillers, monsters that are impervious to magic, Darquesse’s second body, fucking dragons etc) but, throughout the series, we spend less than 100 pages actually in the caves. The fact that the caves have a way to mass produce god killer weapons alone (in a world where gods seem to show up every year) and no one ever thinks to exploit the shit out of that is insane. There should be raiding parties lining up to explore the caves, there should be entire markets focussed on analysing the things that come out of there but it’s forgotten about for almost the entire duration of the series.</p><h3 id=the-faceless-ones-dimension>The Faceless Ones Dimension<a href=#the-faceless-ones-dimension class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>When Skullduggery is trapped in the Faceless One’s dimension at the end of book 3 I though omg this is so hype, we’re gonna get a Valkyrie focussed story where we travel through the Faceless One’s dimension and see all kinds of fucked up shit as she desperately searches for her lost mentor. What we actually got was 80 pages of her trying to find a way into the dimension and 20 pages of her and Skulduggery escaping. After the descriptions of the Faceless Ones in book 3 and how they completely defied human understanding of how the world works, I thought the Faceless One’s dimension would give us insane, mind breaking descriptions, scenes unlike anything I’ve seen. What we got was a broken down town in a desert and Skulduggery was within 100 feet of where the portal opened. There was no exploration, no deepening of our understanding of the lore or of the world, no growth on Valkyrie’s part as she’s forced to survive without her mentor for once, the Faceless Ones barely even showed up. This was immensely disappointing</p><h3 id=the-alternate-universe>The alternate universe<a href=#the-alternate-universe class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Shunting is introduced in book 7 as a way for Argeddion to gain a second version of himself to perform immensely powerful magic. Essentially, Shunters can lock onto a frequency for another universe and move to it, bringing people and things with them. The great majority of universes function completely differently to ours and thus can support human life but we learn of two universes in the series that are suitably similar to earth.</p><p>● The first is simply used to transport a massive sculpture created in another universe into ours for a grand reveal. This is a massive waste of a universe</p><p>● The second is a universe in which wizard Hitler (Mevolent) won his war 400 years ago and now rules the world.</p><p>This second universe is visited multiple times in the series, usually to bring back a macguffin that either hasn’t been invented in our current universe or that was destroyed previously but needs bringing back. Derek Landy teases a universe v universe war a few times but never follows through on it and I find this immensely unsatisfying. In this other universe there is a Skulduggery that never came back from his time as Lord Vile, there is an enemy that many of the characters in the series fought against 400 years ago (Mevolent, one of few people able to stand toe to toe to Darquesse at the end of the series), there are previous final bosses of novels that are never properly re-explored in this new context. There is so much, you could write an entire series just about the interactions that could happen between these two universes but it routinely gets completely forgotten about until our heroes need something from there and then we get treated to a short excursion without any actual resolution for the characters involved.</p><p>This is the most egregious, I believe, of Derek Landy’s unkept promises throughout Skulduggery. Over and over again, he introduces us to potentially amazing plot points but, the second they serve their purpose (whatever that might be) they’re thrown to the wayside for what is often a much less enthralling story.</p><h2 id=overview>Overview<a href=#overview class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>This all culminates into a story where, more often than not, things happen because the author said they do. There’s no real symbolism, no real philosophy, no one person feels real because nothing they do follows our understanding of them. Every story is basically self-contained, with no actual overarching plot outside of “eventually Darquesse appears and kills everyone for some inexplicable reason”. Entire books simply feel like a way to bridge the time gap between the last book and when Darquesse eventually appears. It’s frustrating and disappointing to watch what could have been such a cool series and world be crushed by a lack of creativity or direction over and over again.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/dennis-site/posts/wetherspoons/ class="button inline prev">&lt; [<span class=button__text>Wetherspoons</span>]</a>
