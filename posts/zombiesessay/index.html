The basic premise is that a small, varied cast of characters have, through a variety of circumstances, found themselves trapped together in a house, surrounded by Zombies. Now, though the Zombies gets very little actual screentime throughout the movie, their presence is felt from start to finish. In every single line, every action of every character, there is a tangible fear of the things attempting to enter the house. A great portion of the story is told to us directly through radio broadcasts and TV feed that we listen to as the characters try to defend themselves and the story benefits greatly from this. It puts you in the same situation as the characters, slowly coming to grips with what is happening – watching this with no knowledge of Zombies must have been an incredibly cool experience back when it was first made.</p><p>From the second the doors close, trapping them inside the house, it is made very clear over and over that the Zombies won’t go away and that the characters can’t beat them back. Every time you begin to forget about the threat, every time the characters begin to calm down and properly discuss the situation, you’re immediately reminded you can’t relax. And through this, the characters talk, they argue, even attack one another in an attempt to establish control in a situation where none of them have any real power.</p><p>It’s very clear throughout the movie that the Zombies are an allegory for the ever-present threat of death and that the house is just a microcosm of society, fighting and struggling between each other to control a situation whose outcome has long since been decided. There’s never a single moment during the movie when every character is working together against the actual threat, and I think this is deliberate. The movie is, to me, an analogy for how people hide from their powerlessness before death by attempting to seize the little control that they can. The Zombies then, don’t actually affect the movie much outside of as an instigator, they’re not characters, they’re a force of nature.</p><p>This is where Zombie’s are at their best, I think. Zombies should be seen as a deadline or an impassable wall, some absolute block from which there’s no escape.</p><h2 id=modern-zombie-media>Modern Zombie media<a href=#modern-zombie-media class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>So, I think the appeal of Zombies is heavily dependent on the author, even more so than other fantasy monsters. I remember someone brought up how Vampires are essentially a shoot off of Zombies and I think that comes into it. Zombies are a really simple concept:</p><ol><li><pre><code> They must be dead
</code></pre></li><li><pre><code> They must be capable of movement
</code></pre></li><li><pre><code> They must be able to reproduction
</code></pre></li></ol><p>This means that all the best versions of Zombies I can think of are completely different from one another, because authors can write whatever they want onto Zombies and have it stick. See the following list for some examples:</p><ul><li><p>The Walking Dead: Zombies as a mass of flesh. These zombies have some restrictions like reduced thought and movement and are generally easy kills on their own. They’re only scary because they move in groups, and because they’re relentless pursuers. Zombification is spread through contact, typically biting (I think The Blob also fits into this Zombie archetype but recognise that might be contentious)</p></li><li><p>The Stuff: Zombies as capitalism. Humans who have eaten too much of The Stuff become Zombies essentially controlled by The Stuff to mass produce and sell more to create more Zombies. This kind of Zombie is used to critique capitalism and it’s <em>very</em> effective in doing so even though it has nothing to do with our usual understanding of Zombies. They’re completely conscious, even manipulative when necessary (Zom 100 also uses Zombies like this though it’s Zombies are much closer to the Walking Dead Zombie which I found interesting)</p></li><li><p>I Am Legend (movie): Zombies as victims of prejudice. Here Zombies are used primarily as a character-building tool for our main character, through his prejudice brought about by the deaths of his loved ones, he completely overlooks the fact that the Zombies are conscious living beings and justifies a lot of grim acts against them. The Zombies here are primarily a plot point to force him to confront and overcome his actions and biases. They retain their ‘mass of flesh/work of nature status’ by being the embodiment of the main characters fear, even when that fear is misplaced</p></li><li><p>One Punch Man: Zombies as unkillable. One completely twists Zombies on their head by making a single cool guy who just cannot be killed no matter what happens to his body. I think out of the examples listed this is the least Zombie-like Zombie, to the point that he really doesn’t fit the archetype much at all but he’s a very fun character (we don’t know if he can produce more Zombies, so he arguably does even fit the definition I laid out)</p></li></ul><h2 id=my-issues-with-modern-zombies>My issues with modern Zombies<a href=#my-issues-with-modern-zombies class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>A Zombie Bite is inherently overpowered, Zombies should be a nigh world ending force in most contexts, so they must be diminished to fit into most non-Zombie focused stories. This, paired with their lack of individuality (which limits their ability to function as a final boss or an interesting character in their own right) results in a slow degradation of their power over time. This can be seen even in The Walking Dead, one of the largest Zombie franchises ever, where Zombies aren’t particularly threatening once you understand them; they’re slow and they lack any real thought. This differs massively from how they first appeared in NLD for example where they’re not only capable of moving at speed, when necessary (though still slower than most people), they readily make use of tools and can even set very simple plans (like tipping over a car to get at the people inside).</p><p>This leads to Zombies being seen as minions or ideas like the ‘Evolved Zombie’ (which kind of undermines the whole ‘force of nature’ thing) where certain Zombies are given special abilities to separate themselves from the pack and make fights more interesting. I think this issue partially resolves itself when Zombies are no longer seen as just some fantasy monster and are instead considered a separate thing entirely (the fact Zombies exist in D&amp;D is unforgivable to me). This is because any fantasy series that has both Zombies and other fantasy monsters just simply shouldn’t exist lmao. In a world with a Zombie Dragon, there is nothing else, everything should be dead. The only exception to this is with the Necromancer trope (were I to one day potentially, maybe, possibly write a story it would probably include Necromancy because I have <em>big</em> thoughts on this trope).</p><p>It&rsquo;s for this reason that I really like the Marvel Zombies stories, they’re the only stories I know of that treat Zombies as the threat they really are even in a world where there are other super-human powers.</p><p>Other than that, whilst I appreciate that Zombies are a much bigger part of the public consciousness than they once were, I think this is detrimental to them. Every Zombie story should be completely different; it should be informed both by the characters and the author’s thoughts on and experiences with death. Each authors Zombies should be fundamentally different from one another because everyone has a different relationship with death, everyone sees something different in the abyss. Yet tropism means that the great majority of Zombies in media are just Walkers (“+ these ones can run”, or “+ these ones have a brain”, or “+ these ones are from space” :exploding_head:) and that seems like a massive waste.</p><h2 id=the-bite>The Bite<a href=#the-bite class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>The idea of a Zombie has grown and changed a lot since the release of NLD (‘Zombie’ isn’t even a word in the movie). That said, the core idea remains the same, Zombies are at their best when they are a constant, unstoppable force. They can lose ground, even be forgotten for brief moments but they can never be beaten. A good Zombie or Zombie Horde should feel almost Lovecraftian, as though Cthulhu was wearing your loved one’s skin as a disguise.</p><p>What Zombies are used in service to can vary greatly from story to story but the important part is that long, slow, creeping progress, gradually increasing the tension, sealing off escape routes one by one until the very end and that’s something that I think is exclusive to Zombies (and some serial killer movies ig lmao, but when it’s a person doing it the vibes and possible interpretations of the media are <em>vastly</em> different to most Zombie media).</p><p>It’s for this reason that my favourite trope in Zombie media, possibly even the defining feature of Zombies for me, is The Bite. Once someone has been bitten, they are <em>dead</em>. That is an inviolable rule in Zombie media, subverting that expectation immediately diminishes the Zombie to a nothing monster. That said, The Bite itself can vary greatly – for example, The Stuff turns this on its head completely and the person must consume The Stuff to be Zombified, as opposed to being bitten themselves, making Zombification a choice (trust me, watch The Stuff, it’s dated but dear God it is an amazing movie, it really does everything it wants to perfectly).</p><p>What’s <em>actually</em> important about The Bite isn’t the act but the periods before and after. Before, we need to focus on how The Bite comes about, this needs to be believable, and it needs to be completely unavoidable. An unnecessary Bite immediately ruins audience immersion, it can’t appear forced, but it does need to be necessary. Once this is done, we can focus on the main part: after. The period between The Bite and Zombification is essentially a microcosm of Zombie media itself because the story is one of “unavoidable death”. From the instant a character is bitten to the instant they die, the entire story is theirs, neglecting them at this point is unforgivable; it’s time for a character analysis. This can come in the form of a monologue, a final sacrificial act that might betray our expectations of the character, even just a silent gaze but panning the camera away, even for an instant, goes against the very nature of Zombie media. It’s here where all pretence falls away and we see who the character really is – this is the peak of most Zombie media.</p><p>Zombification can take as short or as long as the author needs (as long as it doesn’t go against a precedent previously set) which makes it the perfect tool for this kind of moment. In other media setting up this moment can take <em>a lot</em> of work, dealing the perfect wounds to your characters to allow them to reasonably last exactly how long you need them to without it seeming too convenient for the plot can be very hard, Zombification simplifies a great deal of that and allows for consistent, amazing character moments.</p><p>It’s for this reason too that any good Zombie media should be short.</p><h2 id=length-of-zombie-media>Length of Zombie media<a href=#length-of-zombie-media class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>There’s a trope in media of useless marksmen (see the entirety of Star Wars) and this exists for a reason. Guns are incredibly hard to write around when your characters are human because a gunshot wound, especially when characters are already in dire circumstances, is essentially an instant death sentence. Trying to write your way out of that can be challenging and requires a lot of set up so most guns in fiction are incredibly underpowered.</p><p>I think the same idea can be applied to Zombies. The Bite is essentially a gun in the hands of every single Zombie, and they’re generally pack animals. It’s for this reason that, whilst initially scary, Zombies tend to become less and less threatening over the course of any long piece of Zombie media. Killing off a character for seemingly no reason can feel punishing to an audience when that character has been built up over seasons of content, so every death must be meaningful but that much set up is incredibly difficult to pull off over and over whilst building up some grand story.</p><p>As such, Zombie media should be short, it should be focussed on setting up one perfect, brutal moment and then a cut to black.</p><h2 id=platos-ideal-zombie-story>Plato’s Ideal Zombie Story<a href=#platos-ideal-zombie-story class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>A collection of short stories set up across various times and locations that, together, tell a greater story about how the Zombies slowly take over the globe but are each themselves ruthlessly short character analyses on small groups of people who are, without exception, woefully unprepared for how the world is changing. The Zombies can be the exact same across the stories or they can vary in such a way that they give each character their own cosmic punishment, relevant to each person’s flaws, but they must be one or the other.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary<a href=#summary class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>The discussion in BAMS raised a good point and that’s that it’s hard to create cool Zombies because they rarely have any actual character outside of the specific quirks the author puts on their type of Zombies. Most modern Zombies lose all personhood during Zombification so a character like Dracula is impossible without fundamentally changing what ‘Zombie’ means. I’d argue that that’s fine because Zombie’s are a fundamentally different monster that fulfils a completely different role to monsters like that. Zombies are entropy given face and I think that’s pretty cool.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/dennis-site/posts/nostars/ class="button inline prev">&lt; [<span class=button__text>If There Were No Stars</span>]</a>
