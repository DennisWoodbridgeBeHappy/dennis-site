She lived a life of endless work, and she earned what she got, and she was proud of that fact. She’d become an Adventurer in hopes of bettering her station and, after a decade of training and fighting and nearly dying, her wishes had been granted.
She glanced over the piles of paperwork laid out before her. She had a meeting with the other Lords of the Northern Hills tomorrow and, as the current most influential Lord, she had to have this done by then to prove she wasn’t in over her head. Of course, I am&mldr; But she couldn’t say that without losing her position and losing that would mean losing everything she had worked so hard to attain over the past ten years of her life. She couldn’t allow that to happen; she’d given up a normal life for Adventuring and gave up Adventuring for this, if that proved to be all for naught now then what had her life been leading up to up until this point? What worth did she have if she couldn’t keep her own lands in check after going through everything, she had to gain them?
The Northern Hills, like many countries on the outskirts of human civilisation were made up of predominantly ex-Adventurers who had taken up residence in the areas the Adventurer’s Guild had &rsquo;liberated&rsquo;. It was for that reason that someone who came from nowhere like Lowri had managed to reach such a high position. Needless to say, this was intentional by the Adventurer’s Guild as it meant that those who couldn’t fight anymore could then raise crops and the like for the Guild on the outskirts of the world rather than having to transport resources in.
Still, despite her need to prove herself, she couldn&rsquo;t help but hope that someone would rush into the room and declare an emergency so she could get out of the work.
“There’s an emergency.” Someone had charged into the room and declared an emergency&mldr; I wish I had enough people working underneath me to ease my work. No one showed up. No, that would be asking too much.<br>“What’s happening?” She had been a ruling Lord for almost five years now and not once had someone charged into her quarters without alerting her first.
“News from Lord Roak has just reached us. He’s asking for immediate reinforcements to be sent east from all Lords.”
“Why?” She questioned impatiently, there hadn’t been any problems with the Dwarves that inhabited the mountain passes to their west for a while now so she couldn’t imagine that would have changed so suddenly. What on Earth could spur Lord Roak into asking for aid?
“An envoy of the Dwarves arrived at his lands earlier this morning. An army of the undead is being led into the mountains as we speak.” An army of the undead? There was no such thing. There couldn’t be. Undead weren’t sentient. What kind of being could have led them?
“Led by what?” Lowri hadn’t yet lived a long life; she was convinced that she still had at least a few decades left in her. As such, she couldn’t say that her knowledge of the undead spread as far as experts and wise men. One thing that had been instilled into her as fact however was that, whilst the undead hated the living, they had never left their swamps was because they weren’t intelligent enough to order themselves. If an undead had spawned with the intelligence of a human, no, even worse might be if it was of a higher race such as a Dwarf or an Elf, then the hills may very well be seeing their last days.
“It seems there is a person at the army’s helm.” That’s not good&mldr; This was even worse than she had imagined. If it was an undead, she could at least say there was a chance they were simply charismatic in the eyes of the undead. A person on the other hand&mldr; It has to be a Necromancer but what kind of Necromancer could control an army of undead? Surely, she would’ve heard tale about something like this had it happened in the past.
“Mobilise every spare soldier we have at our disposal and collect the grain from every field.” She ordered. “Send word north to the Adventurers Guild and request their aid. Then send for further reinforcements from the Monster Hunters Guild. They might not arrive in time to save us but the least we can do is lay the foundations for the army’s defeat once we’re gone.”
“Miss&mldr;” Her soldier seemed exhausted. “Another message was received from south this morning. It seems a Demon Lord was summoned in the capital of Withral, and they are still dealing with the aftermath. We can’t expect any help from them.”
A Demon Lord&mldr; At least this was a threat she had heard about before. Was this just bad luck? She had to wonder if she was being tested; surely a leader of the undead and a Demon Lord couldn’t appear at almost the same time simply by coincidence. Then Monster Hunter Guild will be in no position to aid us.
“Send a message anyway. Tell them any help will be invaluable; we can’t afford to worry about appearances now. Do the same with the other smaller Guilds that are stationed close enough to make it in time.” For a moment, she paused, looking over the paperwork around her. At least I have an excuse to avoid this for now&mldr; “Prepare me a carriage immediately. I’ll arrive first and begin the discussion over strategy whilst the troops are on their way.” The messenger nodded and rushed out to do as ordered. The second he had left, Lowri’s head was placed in her hands. How many undead inhabit the swamps on the other side of those mountains? If all of them had been brought over, then&mldr; How am I supposed to fight that?</p><h2 id=lowri-2>Lowri 2<a href=#lowri-2 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Lowri had arrived at Lord Roak’s less than a day into her journey; thankfully, even though the terrain here was much rougher than in most other human kingdoms the Northern Hills was still almost laughably small in comparison to those Kingdoms so travelling between Noble’s lands was a relatively simple matter. Pair that with the fact Lowri was a neighbouring Lord to Roak and any horse could make the trip in one leg with stamina magic.
Still, she had been provided a room for the night, and, despite the urgency, talks were put off temporarily to allow the other Lords to arrive. Despite her obvious and reasonable urgency, she managed to get to sleep and was greeted in the morning by one of the guards she had brought along.
“Miss.” He addressed her as she sat up. “The meeting will begin shortly; we were told that the final Lord has arrived not too long ago.” Needless to say, he didn’t mean the final Lord in the Northern Hills, just of those who had bothered to answer the plea for help; everyone here might have originated from the Adventurer’s Guild but that didn’t mean they were on the same side. Some wouldn’t have believed Roak; other simply wouldn’t have seen it as their business.
“Understood, wait outside.” The guard nodded and took his leave. Perhaps it was somewhat rude of her to speak like that to someone who had likely been holding that posture for a few hours simply to guarantee her safety, but the thought only occurred to her afterwards. I still need to act like a Lady. That was true no matter the situation. She looked in disgust at the bed she had been forced into.
I get that I wasn’t the first person to respond, and Lord Roak has a lot of guests to entertain but I am his strongest ally&mldr; Was there not a single better room? This wasn’t just an insult to her; it reflected just as badly on him that he couldn’t procure a better stay for her time here. If things have gotten to this point, then it must be bad&mldr; It was hard to get any form of resources this far north anyway so it was only expected for some Lords to suffer; there was only so much you could grow without foreign aid. Then again&mldr; This time, her vision wandered across herself. It’s not like I don’t suit this room.
Her hair was unkempt, her bed-clothes unwashed and there was still dirt on her face that had been kicked up at her on her way out of the carriage yesterday. After six hours of travelling, she simply couldn’t be bothered enough to clean up when she would only be being seen by guards. Finally, fully awake, she stripped off her clothes and redressed herself in a spare set she had brought with her; a long, light blue dress and the necessary jewellery to go with it. A quick splash of water on her face before the light make up went on. Then, setting her hair into a simple bun for now, she exited the room and was greeted once more by the two guards at her door. Somewhat more presentable now, it was easier to maintain her superior atmosphere. I still can’t stand dresses though&mldr; She’d brought the suit of armour she had worn as an Adventurer just in case but, now that she thought about it properly, it would probably be deemed inappropriate for a Lady like herself to wear something so rugged. Putting that aside&mldr;
“Guide me to the meeting.” It seemed that many nobles had been forced into the same inn as she could already see some note-worthy faces coming down from the stairs to her left. Nevertheless, she couldn’t simply follow them, so her already tired soldiers were given another job.
The distance was short, only a couple of buildings down the road, but that was likely intentional on the part of Lord Roak to ensure the meeting could start as soon as possible. Was that why he made me stay in such a sub-par inn then? No doubt that would be his excuse at least. She could see the various civilians on the street, the great majority of them either ex-Adventurers, merchants or migrants that had tried for a better life away from their families, turning her way as she walked gracefully behind her guards. It was for this reason primarily that she had always wanted a high position, the attention of the masses, but now that she was here, she couldn’t help but find it annoying. It’s because of these people that I have to wear something so uncomfortable&mldr;
Still, that didn’t stop her; she’d already had sufficient experience in dealing with those gazes to know that acknowledging them was the worst possible thing to do if you wanted to pass undisturbed, and she quickly arrived at her destination. It seemed at first glance to be a church for one of the six Gods, most likely Efrete given the floral decorations that surrounded it, and that was no doubt its original purpose. Now however, it was the only building big enough in this town to seat all the Lords and Ladies that had arrived as well as their guards and so it had been repurposed as a war room. There’ll be hell to pay for this if the Church finds out&mldr; No doubt Lord Roak had temporarily cut contact with the outside world simply to avoid word of this getting out.
Heading inside, Lowri seated herself opposite Lord Roak in the highest seat provided as was suitable for someone who held the most power in the room. Lord Roak was in the lowest as he was the one making a request for aid and, running up both sides of the table between them were ten others, behind which stood an assortment of various colours of armour. It wasn’t that Lowri was unrivalled in her power; she held the most power of those gathered here but that didn’t mean she was untouchable, rather many present even now were already encroaching upon her. The reason no-one else challenged her for the top seat was because she had once been a Reaper and, even now, they didn’t fancy their chances no matter how many soldiers they had standing guard over them.
The only one absent of any guards was Lord Roak, once more, customary of someone making a request. That didn’t mean that his presence alone wasn’t threatening enough though. A smaller chair couldn&rsquo;t change the fact that he towered over Lowri, and his broad shoulders blocked the entrance behind him despite being slightly slumped forwards. Every Lord here had once been an Adventurer, but he was the only other to have been given the title of Reaper, the difference in strength between them and the other lords was obvious even though they had all been slacking on training since gaining their respective titles.
“Everyone who responded to my request for aid has gathered so I’ll begin.” Roak spoke from his seat at the bottom of the table. Lowri suppressed the urge to chuckle at how he was irritably shuffling about, his knees sticking up to his stomach due to the excessively small chair in comparison to his excessively large body. “I’m sure that those that have arrived don’t doubt my intentions, nor my word so I’ll tell all I know and nothing more nor less. Yesterday morning, a Dwarven messenger arrived at my gates requesting an immediate audience with me. I hadn’t heard from the Dwarves since the Non-Aggression Treaty so, naturally, I was confused about his presence and gave the audience.
“He told me this; an army of the undead had been spotted entering Dwarven territory only two days ago as of today. Usually, the Dwarves would deal with undead threats themselves because it’s rare that more than a small group would move as one so they could be easily suppressed but this time, their council judged that there was no way to fight back against the number of undead that was approaching them without outside aid. It was then voted upon, and they voted to hide with a 6:1 majority.” That meant that six of the remaining seven factions of Dwarves had voted to abandon any hope of fighting and simply let the undead pass over them and into human territory. “The Dwarf that arrived here is from the faction of Dwarves that voted to stay and fight, he says that a small army of Dwarves is heading our way to aid us in fighting.”
“The Dwarves have not fought on the side of humans once throughout history, what makes this case different?” Lowri asked on behalf of all the nobles there who were undoubtedly thinking the same.
“Apparently, the size of the army was beyond belief. The reason the faction gave for joining us was because ‘if the army wasn’t defeated here, they never would be’.” The fact that the Dwarves, even if not all of them, were willing to see past century old grudges was surprising in and of itself but what he had said was unthinkable. It was true that this town was in an opportune position from which to launch an attack on anything coming from the mountains, it was for that reason it had been built here whilst the Adventurer’s Guild still occupied this area but the undead were famously weak beings as it was. Skeletons, no, even Liches could easily be over-powered by the average Adventurer, the army would have to out-number them by at least 10:1 to stand a chance, there was no way an individual could control that many undead at once.
“Are there any more details on the leader of the army?” It seemed another noble has reached the same conclusion as Lowri. The battle rests on the strength of that person and whether we can wrestle control of the undead away from him.
“In the message I sent out, I stated that it was likely a human but, upon closer analysis we doubt it.” Roak responded. “That was an evaluation made upon very little information, upon further questioning of the Dwarven envoy; we found out that the leader of the army was stated as having withered skin and bright blue eyes.” That description clearly matched that of an Elder Lich, but two things stood out. How could an Elder Lich be mistaken for a human? Was the first. But, even if it is an Elder Lich, I’ve never heard of an Elder Lich capable of controlling more than 20 undead at once and, even then, they were low level. There was simply no way for it to be an Elder Lich, so the only other possibility was&mldr;
“Do you mean to say that this is an Undead more powerful than an Elder Lich?” Even someone like Lowri knew that, as an Undead would grow in power, it would be able to control more of its own kind. Not just that but it regained some features of the living as well such as skin or muscle. It was a stretch but, given how long the swamps had been left untouched, it shouldn&rsquo;t have been too surprising for enough undead to have spawned for something like this to happen. Rather, someone should have seen it coming.
“For now, at least, it has been dubbed an Undead General for ease.” Lord Roak responded calmly, it seemed this idea had been around for some time now. No doubt, this was another reason for the meeting to have been postponed; so that the one asking for help could gather as much information as possible before releasing it to everyone else. “In addition to a boost in strength, we imagine that it is also at least moderately intelligent. That is, enough to lead an army as well as any human might.”
“You’re saying it’s intellect is on par with a human’s?”
“I see no other way it would be able to command such a large force.” His response was immediate and confidant. Roak had always had a super-human sense for battle, if he said it was true then the others had no choice but to accept it as fact.
“Very well.” Lowri intervened before the silence could drag on too long. “Then the army itself? I assume you have at least a relatively accurate estimate for the number’s we’re facing?” Even if it can control fifty Elder Liches at once, they can control twenty Liches each then each of them controls four skeletons that’s only&mldr; 5,000 enemies roughly. With the cover of the mountains and the town walls we’d be able to take that on with just 500 of our own. Lowri’s mood was suddenly much brighter, not just at the thought of an easy victory but at the fact that she’d remembered some of the maths she had picked up as a child.
“The Dwarves estimated the number of Skeletons to exceed 30,000.” What? That was impossible&mldr; For that to even be plausible, each Elder Lich would need to control three times as many Liches and the same for those Liches to the Skeletons. For the first time since arriving, she felt she might have been lied to.
“Lord Roak, I hold a significant amount of respect for you as a warrior. If you say that you believe this claim then I will respect that as well, but I would warn you not to lie to me, you aren’t the only Reaper in this room.” The air thickened with tension from her words.
“It is believed that the Skeletal Commander can use a spell that means the undead controlled by him can each increase their influence three-fold.” Roak responded without pause. “If you don’t believe me then I will gladly call in the messenger who had to run for his life against that very army, but I warn you he’s quite shaken up.”
“I didn’t say I don’t believe you. Simply that there is always the possibility that the Dwarves are exaggerating the matter to gain our aid.” The two watched each other for a while, neither passing a word to the other. “As I said, if you trust them then so do I, I simply wanted to ensure that you weren’t being led astray; you haven’t been in the field for a few years now, correct? You can continue with your analysis.”
“You mean to say I might have lost my edge?” That wasn’t her intention at all, but Roak was someone who valued strength above all else, it would be hard to calm him down now. He stood up and pounded his fist on the table. “I would gladly battle you if you think I’ve wavered from my calling.”
“Then we will hold a duel once this matter is resolved, there are more important matters to attend to.” Her eyes flicked to the frightened nobles that sat between them, not wanting to be caught up in a match between the duo. Some of them seemed too tired to care what happened at this moment, likely the ones that had travelled here through the night, but they were the minority. Roak sat back down, annoyed. “Continue.”
“The Dwarves estimate the number of Skeletons to surpass 30,000, the Liches just below 3,000 and around 50 Elder Liches. Unfortunately, that’s not all.” There’s still more? “Three more monsters have been spotted.”
“What difference can three monsters make?” One of the more ignorant nobles questioned, his exhaustion getting the better of his fear.
“Be quiet.” Lowri hushed.
“Two Skeletal Dragons have been seen alongside the army and there are reports of something moving beneath the ground as well. Though we have no confirmation as to what it is yet, it’s likely to be another unseen monster.” Two&mldr; She couldn’t even finish the thought. Skeletal Dragons, like all other undead that turn from corpses, lose a great amount of their strength from when they were alive so they could never stand up to actual Dragons but, even then, they were a frightening enemy for a human. Even a Reaper would be hard pressed to fight against one alo- No, maybe it was more accurate to say even a Reaper couldn’t fight them alone.
“I understand.” Lowri’s response was somewhat solemn. Roak wouldn&rsquo;t lie about something like that. He’s too proud to say that he was being threatened by something stronger than himself. He wouldn’t even reveal this information unless it was proved to him as iron clad. Whilst she remained quiet, there was uproar across the table.
“You called us here to our deaths!” And other such comments were thrown around. None of them were seeing the bigger picture. Lowri stood for the first time since the meeting began, and the entire table quietened in an instant.
“He did nothing of the sort.” No one objected, everyone was dead-silent now that she had spoken. “He called you here to give you a chance at a last stand, one that doesn’t end in the deaths of you and everyone you know.” She paused for a moment. “This town gives us an advantage that no other place could hope to match, if that army gets through here then nothing will stop it. For that reason, I ask that you stop thinking about your own selfish desires and join the cause because, if you don’t, then we’ll all die. Even together we might not be enough, but we have a much higher chance than on our own.” No one moved, whether that was out of respect or fear was unclear. “How long do we have until the Dwarves arrive?”
“Two days.”
“And the undead?”
“One week. Most.”
“You heard him.” Lowri scanned the other nobles present. “You have one week to gather your troops here. If you try running, I&rsquo;ll kill you myself.” There was an audible gulp at that. “Don’t think you can escape this; I’ll be doing you a favour by killing you before they get their hands on you. And, for your sake, I suggest you pull in as many favours as possible.”</p><h2 id=lowri-3>Lowri 3<a href=#lowri-3 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Two days had passed since her arrival, but things hadn’t gotten any easier over that period for Lowri. Adventurers and Lord’s armies had been arriving at all times of the day and night, and they had received a response from the Monster Hunter Guild telling them a total of 300 extra troops were being sent their way, led by a Purple. All in all, over 4,000 fighters had already arrived with an expected 1,000 more on the way. With these numbers they stood no chance. An extra four Reapers had already arrived, and they would prove invaluable in the battle that was about to take place but that didn’t mean that they alone could change its outcome. The outcome of the battle was now relying solely on the Dwarven reinforcements that were due to arrive today.
“Speaking of the Monster Hunters&mldr;” Lowri spoke aloud to herself, finally having realised something she ought to have understood a while back. It’s all the pressure&mldr; How can I be expected to be performing my best in a situation like this? “The Guild Leader said that another unit had been dispatched from Withral right? What could they have meant by that?”
Her question was directed at no one as no one was in the room with her, but she truly did need an answer. It could take over half a year for him to reach us here. There’s no way he could arrive in time for the battle so why even bother sending him over? That said, there was an even more confusing part of this situation. “Even if he got here, it’s not like one person could affect the outcome of a battle, especially not when we’re this far outmatched&mldr;”
She’d been alone with her thoughts for far too long already and they were beginning to get the better of her. She needed a distraction but there wasn’t much for her to do in the lead up to the battle; she had been voted the leader of the army but, after declaring the tactics they would use and the positions of the troops she was already out of duties. Besides, it wasn’t like any concrete plans could be made until the Dwarves arrived anyway since they didn’t yet even know the extent of their own forces. The result was a mess of a person that anyone could see shouldn’t be leading this many troops. Her nails had been bitten down as far as they would go and, unless she was in the public eye, she was no longer bothering to even try cleaning herself up. Nevertheless, time was running out and that army was bearing down upon her, getting closer with each passing day. Why is it so slow though? They’re the untiring undead, how can they not move quicker? The truth was that, as someone who had fought in large groups before now, she knew an army could only travel as quickly as the slowest soldier, but she couldn’t help but think that it had been done purposefully to try and break her will. A knock sounded at the door.
“Give me a minute to prepare.” She’d told the guards stationed outside to not bother interrupting her unless someone significant was to request her presence. As such, she knew her current appearance wouldn’t do before even asking what had happened. “Who is it that’s requested for me?” Tidying up her clothes, brushing her hair back, applying light make up, they were all done hurriedly and half-heartedly at best. There was no helping her nails, so she hid them inside a pair of sleek white gloves.
“The Dwarves have arrived and asked to speak with whoever was to lead us into battle immediately.” So, it’s already that time&mldr; Now she would have to argue over who got primary control over the army once more. One of her main standing points in the argument against the other Lords was that she had supplied 15% of the fighting force – more than any Lord beside Roak who owned the land they stood upon, how would that fare now? She couldn’t imagine the Dwarven forces would be so meagre as to be beaten out by her.
“Very well.” Having finished preparing herself, Lowri allowed the guard to open her door and lead her back towards the church. This time, the table had been changed as to accommodate just two people of equal standing. A Dwarf already sat in the left seat, so she took the right and, seeing that he had no guards present, sent her own to stand outside the doors. Thinking back on it, his troops are likely still outside of the city walls. It was probably insulting just to bring a guard this far when he’s willing to put himself in this sort of danger.
Once she was face-to-face, she managed to get what was likely the first look she had ever had at a Dwarf’s face that wasn’t across a battlefield. He had a somewhat rugged beard and yellowish skin. His hair was brown and, though he was a Dwarf, he was only slightly smaller than Lowri.
“I’m sorry, I haven’t yet been told which Dwarven faction it was that has allied itself with us so I can’t put a name to your face.” She broke the silence as politely as possible.
“My title is similar to a Lord’s so you can simply call me by that if it’s easier, my given name is Vormir of the Trolder faction.” Trolder? It must have been one of the factions that were stationed further into the mountain range as she couldn’t remember ever having fought them. That explains why they were sympathetic at least. They’ve dealt with the undead before, so they know just how much of a threat this is.
“Welcome Lord Vormir, sorry to get straight into it but I’m sure you know we really don’t have the time for pleasantries.” She realised that he hadn’t even been presented with a drink immediately after having said this. “It’s for that reason that I won’t pretend we’re in a good state. We can only support our current numbers for a month at most so, in case the enemy attempts to lay siege to us, we can’t spare any resources.” He nodded slightly; he had seen the human troops attempting to crowd into buildings clearly made for much fewer than were currently inhabiting them. Still, it was better than devastating moral by having them stay outside.
“It’s to be expected, my troops have brought along with them enough to last a similar period, if slightly shorter.”
“Then please, let’s not get caught up on small things and work together in this. How many troops have you brought?” This was beyond direct, something that would be seen as beyond insulting under normal circumstances, but it couldn’t be helped.
“I’ve brought every capable man and woman under my command that isn’t necessary for the upkeep of the faction and every one of them is armoured with rune weapons, in total it numbers around 4,000.” So, we really were on even footing then&mldr; It’s amazing he even managed to bring this number of soldiers through the mountains without being caught by Giants. A Dwarf’s place was the tunnels, no one would deny that, so even moving around above ground was risky for them and was only ever done to farm that which couldn’t be done underground or to meet with those of other species. “Then, I’ve also brought along a total of 50 Centurions.”
“I see, that’s reassuring.” A Centurion was a machine-made using rune-crafting techniques unique to the Dwarves and could easily kill any Green Monster Hunter or any normal Adventurer. Fifty of those machines would certainly be of significant aid in the following battle if they were utilised properly. With these many reinforcements, they were beginning to see an actual chance at winning even if just barely. “That means we should have a collective force of around 9,000. With those numbers we might-”
“I doubt it.” She was interrupted before she could even finish the thought. Vormir didn’t give her that luxury. “You know as well as I do the legends around Skeletal Dragons.” It was true that she had heard rumours, but the existence of a Skeletal Dragon had never even been confirmed outside of legend until recently so how they could base their assumptions off that. “They can completely ignore magic up to the fifth tier; that includes all forms of wild magic that you humans use.”
“It’s true that could be troublesome, but we don’t even know if that information is trustworthy. No one alive has ever fought a Skeletal Dragon before.” In legend it supposedly took four people of Reaper-level to suppress a single Skeletal Dragon, all of which were power based. The magic casters that had supported them proved useless as, when it closed in on them, all wild magic simply stopped working.
“Still, now we know that Skeletal Dragons exist we should pay mind to those legends at least. Then, even if the legends are false, there’s now an undead capable of controlling two of those monstrosities. No doubt that Undead General alone will prove a huge threat.” She couldn’t argue against that, it would be the point that the battle focussed on. If they had more information about it then they’d be able to adapt their strategy to better deal with the Undead General but, as of now, all they could do was hope to surround it and over-whelm it with numbers, not that they had superior numbers in the first place. “Very well, what are the current battle-plans?”
“It’s most likely that the army of the undead will pass through this valley just before they reach this city because trekking across the mountains would take much, much longer.” Lowri pointed at a part of the map that had been spread across the table. “The assault will start there. We’ll be lining the walls of the valley with Magic Archers who will rain down as many Magic Arrows as possible before they’re spotted. At that point, our forces will retreat into the city and the doors will be shut.”
“They’re undead, what effect will arrows have?” It seemed that he truly hadn’t fought against Adventurers much.
“The spell Magic Arrow creates an arrow that deals a set amount of damage when it hits, rather than relying on that damage coming from blood-loss.” Against most enemies, Magic Arrow was deemed too weak to be used in actual combat but the Adventurers that had gathered here had likely brushed into the undead a few times. A great majority of them should have the Magic Arrow spell as a precaution even if the Adventurer’s Guild hadn’t told them to learn it. “That makes it one of few long-range attacks effective against the undead.”
Vormir nodded and allowed her to continue.
“The distance between their positions on the valley and the city itself is only around 500 metres so no Adventurers should be incapable of running the distance. That said, the undead will follow shortly after so the closing of the doors must be done as soon as the final Adventurer is inside. Once that’s done, they’ll join the other Adventurers on the city walls and continue firing magic arrows down at the undead.”
“Where will my forces be during this?”
“The Dwarves and those under the Lords will always be inside of the walls. When we can no longer keep the undead outside the walls, we’ll open the doors and funnel them through that opening to thin the numbers that we’re dealing with at one time. I want your Centurions to lead that assault so that we can avoid lives being lost for as long as possible.” Another nod, it seemed he agreed to what she had said up to this point. “During this time, the Reapers and the Monster Hunter Guild’s Purple will be keeping eyes on the army. It’ll be our job to immediately scout out the Dragons, the Commander and the other monster you warned us of and separate them from the main force until the army is dealt with.”
“That just leaves the Elder Liches then. What’s your plan for them?” He was right. The Skeletons and Liches could be wiped out with ease but, even assuming the Reapers and a single Purple could hold off those four powerful enemies, the Elder Liches were too strong for even a Dwarven Centurion to face alone. Eventually the forces inside of the city would be overwhelmed. That thought was the main cause of cause of the twists in her gut.
“Thankfully this city was built with war in mind; the walls and houses are made of stone, so they won’t fall even if our enemy were to attempt to burn us out.” At first, her statement seemed random. “That means that Firebolt, the Elder Liches’ main attacking spell, can’t do as much damage as it usually would whilst they’re inside the city. We must put our hopes on the thought that that might even the playing field.”
Neither spoke for a long time. This was the best plan the Lords could come up with between them and it seemed Vormir couldn’t best it either.
“We have traps being set up around the city even as we speak that’ll help and our height advantage on the walls will mean that less Magic Arrows miss their marks but, in the end, it’s up to the troops on the ground and whether they can hold out for long enough or not.”
“Very well, I’ll inform my troops of their positions. Where will we be staying in the meantime?”
“I believe Lord Roak has already prepared lodgings for you, he’ll be at the gate no doubt. You might find them lacking but please bear in mind that this city was never made to house the number of people we are currently attempting to.” A final nod and he made his way out of the room.
Once more, Lowri’s head went into her hands and her rapidly beating heart calmed down somewhat now that Vormir had left. That went better than expected. Thankfully, it seemed she had impressed him enough with her preparations to avoid the conversation over who was to lead the army. Still, she couldn’t say it was over yet. She still had her meeting with the other Reapers this afternoon, then she would also have to meet with the Monster Hunters when they arrived as well&mldr; She still had a lot of work cut out for her. Too much work. It was then that she heard it.
‘Hello?’ A voice reverberated through her mind, an unfamiliar voice. She was used to this feeling because she’d used the Message spell herself quite a few times both in her life as an Adventurer and outside of it simply for how useful and easy to learn it was, making contact over 100’s of miles possible instantaneously. This was the first time she’d ever been contacted by someone she hadn’t met in real life though.
‘Who is this?’ She responded in an instant, shocked at having been disrupted when she was finally beginning to relax. To cast Message, you would usually need the permission of the other person but there were cases when it was possible to ignore this rule, such as if the one casting the spell was significantly more experienced with the spell than the other or if the caster had enough mana to overcome the target’s resistance to it altogether. She wasn’t wearing any items that boosted her resistance to this type of attack at the moment, but it surprised her that even her natural resistances might have been overcome. If that’s the case, then he’ll struggle to keep the spell active for long&mldr;
‘Me? Erm, I’m Rufus, the Purple heading your way from Withral? The Guild leader told me to contact you whilst I’m travelling.’ That was a lie. Not only was he overcoming her resistance, but he was doing so from that far away? Message wasn’t a particularly taxing spell, but any human would already have exhausted all their mana simply trying to accomplish what he claimed to be capable of. But why would he lie? ‘This is Looow-Lowri right? The current leader of the Northern Hills.’
‘There is no leader of the Northern Hills each Lord holds comparable power to the others, there is no one person who could claim leadership.’
‘But you were the one put in charge of leading the army alongside the Dwarves&mldr;’ He seemed surprised that there wasn’t a central power. ‘I just figured someone who took the lead in dealing with other countries would obviously be the leader. Forgive my ignorance, I’m sorry if I insulted you.’
‘You’re forgiven, now what is it that you’ve contacted me to discuss? Before you respond, know that I believe you coming here is a waste of your own time. There’s no way you’ll arrive in time.’ Somewhat annoyed by the fact that she wasn’t being given a second to relax, she continued the conversation despite herself.
‘I don’t plan on arriving before the undead reach the city you’re holed up in. I plan on getting there before the Northern Hills are wiped out.’ That was an incredibly direct thing to say to the leader of the army that was supposed to be protecting them. ‘I believe you’ll lose this battle, and, without my help, the Northern Hills will then be overrun.’
‘You seem to have an awful lot of confidence in yourself.’ Lowri knew that, should this man be who he claimed to be, then he certainly was a strong warrior; taking out a Demon Lord was certainly a huge accomplishment and certainly at least made him a candidate for the strongest human warrior currently alive. That said, she couldn’t allow that sort of attitude to continue. ‘How much do you think one person can do against an army of the undead?’
‘I doubt I can take them all on at once if that’s what you’re asking. No, I doubt I’m even capable of taking that Undead General on in a one on one, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m your best bet. Ahh well, I didn’t contact you to talk about my own strength, I contacted you to ask you to run.’ What was that? The anger she felt earlier was nothing compared to this.
‘You say you want me to run whilst my men are putting their lives on the line for the Northern Hills?’ The very thought made her blood boil. ‘I am a warrior even before I am a Lord, I won’t run away from a battle when so much is on the line.’
‘I have my reasons.’ In comparison, this man seemed beyond calm. ‘I need strong people to still be alive when I arrive there to help me in my battle against the army. ‘
‘That doesn’t change the fact that-’ She was cut off before she could even finish the thought.
‘Sorry, this conversation is a bit draining; maybe it’s because of the distance between us? Anyway, I’ll be quick so just listen to me. I’m not asking you to abandon the fight, fight to your heart’s content, I’m sure you’re capable of whittling the army down for me. What I’m saying is that, if it gets to the point that your forces stand no chance and are about to be defeated, run as fast as you can and keep running until you can’t run anymore. They won’t chase after just one person when there’s an entire town to attack, right? Even if it’s just you, make sure you escape.’
The connection was beginning to falter now. I can’t tell whether it would be more impressive if he was faking this or not&mldr; If someone was able to even alter the spell to suit their needs, then it would show a control over magic she’d never even heard of before.
‘When my magicule stores have replenished, I’ll teleport a ring to your person. Press the crystal on top of it should the situation we discussed happen. Now, I’m sorry to say this but I’m running low on strength, so this’ll be the end of our talk.’ In an instant, the spell was cut off and she was left alone once more with even more on her mind.</p><h2 id=lowri-4>Lowri 4<a href=#lowri-4 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Another few days had passed and Lowri’s nerves hadn’t gotten any better. The Monster Hunters had arrived this morning and had settled in immediately alongside the others. Now came the hard part. The battle would begin two days from now and pretty much all the necessary preparations had been made. The one thing left to do was to speak to the Purple and the other Reapers before heading into battle. Only one more Reaper had arrived since then despite the influx of Adventurers, so they had been left with only seven at their disposal.
Maybe that was a bit rude for her to think, this was likely the largest gathering of Reapers since the beginning of the Adventurer Guild after all, but it was still a ridiculously small number for a group intending to face off with two Skeletal Dragons, much less the other threats they had to hold off. She couldn’t help but think that the man that had contacted her had been right about their chances. Speaking of that man, she had received the ring he promised to send over but they hadn’t spoken since. Still, that didn’t mean she had simply forgotten about him. Instead, he was simply another thing to worry about when she found herself with some alone time.
“I’ve gathered you here to inform of where you’ll be positioned during the upcoming battle.” She put useless thoughts out of her mind and focussed on those in front of her, the very warriors that she had so mindlessly insulted earlier on. Thankfully for her, the Reapers had a long-time grudge against undead like most of the Adventurer’s Guild that had been stationed in the Northern Hills and, further up, still are so most of those present had fallen into line simply out of shared interests. There were a couple, the Purple included, that were slightly more troublesome, but she had put out much worse fires over the past week.
“&mldr;” Lord Roak was watching her with a careful eye. She was reminded that they still hadn’t had their duel and, at this rate, probably never would.
“It has been decided that us Reapers alongside the Purple with us, Rend, will be in charge of distracting and separating the more powerful threats from the rest of the army until it’s been dealt with.” She took a deep breath; this part especially would take a lot of guts. “That will include two Skeletal Dragons, a single Undead General and one other that we have yet to attain any information on.” Voices had already picked up, but she broke through them in an instant. “This isn’t about winning; it’s about giving the others the time to finish off the undead army. In the city, we have the advantage, even if only slightly. Our job is to allow that battle to finish as it should and then, along with the survivors’ aid, beat the enemy back afterwards.”
“Assuming we can stay standing that long.” Balk complained. “And that the troops are capable of taking on that army.” He was a rugged man, more fat than muscle and a beard that stretched down to his chest.
“He’s right.” Leila continued, an assassin type Reaper with the dark clothing and small posture to match. “You say we’re trying to buy time, but you also estimated there to be 50 Elder Liches in that army. There’s no way ordinary troops could hold off against that force; on the contrary, allowing the Elder Liches to kill that many people would just make them stronger.”
“I don’t mean to sound rude when I say this and I certainly don’t want to be the one to question a Reaper but&mldr;” Rend, the only purple that could be brought here on such short notice, spoke up now and Lowri could tell that it wouldn’t be in her favour. “You don’t intend for us all to die in this battle, do you?” They’d realised. There was no hiding it now; her slight hesitation was enough to give away the secret. There was uproar among the participants, but she quietened it by signalling for Roak to smack his hand on the table. There was an immense bang, and the rest silenced themselves.
“I’ll admit it; this battle is beyond something that those here can stop.” The noise picked up again but quietened at a glare this time. “That’s why this battle isn’t about winning or losing. It’s about destroying as much of the enemy force as possible. The Monster Hunter Guild has sent reinforcements our way that can finish the job once the enemy spreads across the hills, but our job is to minimise the number of deaths necessary for them to do so.” She had to lie; she couldn’t tell them that only one soldier had been dispatched to help them.
“You’re asking us to go into a hopeless battle.” Tyler, usually a stoic and brave man, was already preparing to leave. She didn’t want to have to say this, but it seemed like the only way to keep her forces intact. Deep breath.
“I have a direct link open with the leaders of both the Adventurer’s and Monster Hunter’s Guilds as we speak. Anyone who is willing to leave to save their life can do so now but let it be known that you will be hunted down for the rest of your lives by your previous employers.” Tyler froze, as did a couple others who had already stood to leave. No matter how strong you were, being a target of the major Guilds was a death sentence anyway. “We need every man and woman we can get in the upcoming fight; I will do anything in my power to increase that number as much as possible. If you want to leave then do so but, unless you flee off the edge of the map, the Guilds will find you.” For a short while, time seemed to stop as those gathered there made up their minds.
Tyler sat back down but two of the others stood back up to replace him; Harp and Farik, two Reapers that did almost everything together. They had a son.
“I’d rather live on the run than purposefully chuck my life away.” Farik spoke in his gruff voice, watching over the remaining Reapers. “If you had half a brain, you’d do the same.” The two left the building. No doubt, they would leave town before night fell.
“Is anyone else going to leave?” No-one moved. “Very well, then I suggest you help set up the defences around the castle, you’ll each be informed of your positions later today.” With that, the remaining Reapers and the single Purple filed out of the room, leaving Lowri alone with her thoughts; the two Guild leaders had cut their connection as soon as the meeting ended. There were mere days until the battle began, and she had no more hope for victory than she had when she first found out about the Skeletal Commander.
‘Hello.’ This voice was beginning to feel all too familiar.
“Can’t you see that I’m trying to think?” That was probably rude, but she didn’t care, even in this situation, this man seemed to find a way to annoy her.
‘Sorry, I was just calling to say that I wouldn’t be able to talk anymore. I’m saving up my mana for the battle so I can’t afford to lose any more in contacting you. Did you receive the ring I sent?’
“Yes, I got the ring.” It was a small, golden circlet with an emerald embedded into the top.
‘Good, whe- If you lose the upcoming battle and are about to die, just press the emerald.’ She glanced over his irritating comment for now and looked down at the little gem.
“What does it do?”
‘Anyway, this is already draining so I’m going to leave you to it.’ The connection cut off and Lowri was left to steam. He’d completely ignored her question. When they met&mldr; She might just kill him herself before the Skeletal Commander got the chance.</p><h2 id=alice-1>Alice 1<a href=#alice-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>She’d joined the Adventurer’s Guild to get away from her family but that wasn’t a special story within the major Guilds. Rather, more people were similar in their reasons for joining than weren’t. She wasn’t particularly strong, and she knew that, hence why she was constantly jumping between teams to reinforce the lands that the Adventurer’s Guild claimed rather than sitting on the front lines. She never imagined that she would end up in a battle like this.
The army had been visible since the prior night, and they were still drawing in. The operation in the mountain range had apparently been a great success, even managing to take out a small chunk of the Elder Liches in the confusion once they started firing. That said, she wasn’t allowed out of the city walls so that might have been a lie fed to the troops to keep spirits up and she wouldn’t know. All that was left was to ensure the city didn’t fall.
The forces had been prepared for battle for hours now, slowly growing tired as the enemy approached. No-one had slept properly last night or the night before. Ever since the Reapers left their meeting looking at the floor spirits had been down and the long wait for the beginning of battle hadn’t helped. The Reapers had already been dispatched to the walls, ready to remove the main opponents from battle as soon as they showed themselves, so the ground troops had been left with seconds-in-command and newly promoted captains to lead them. Their order was a mess but, with orders from Reaper Lowri, they managed to at least maintain a semblance of cohesion. That said, anyone with some slight form of military training could tell that the army was beginning to wane. Thankfully for her, Alice was blissfully ignorant to that fact so she could continue onwards as battle approached fearing for her life but at least believing their side would win in the end. She was one of very, very few that still believed they stood a chance.
Aside from Reaper Lowri, hatred for the undead was the only thing holding the soldiers up by the time that call came.
“Prepare for battle.” The soldiers sluggishly stood to their feet. Alice had been assigned to the courtyard, so her job was primarily to transport resources to those on the walls and await the inevitable opening of the gates. As such, those around hadn’t even bothered to pick up their weapons until expressly told to do so. Buckets of stones and boiling oil were still being passed along the back ranks towards the nearest walls. She could already hear the first few Magic Arrows being shot over the walls. The earth was shaking under the force of the charging army. It wouldn’t be long now.
Thuds on the walls. She couldn’t see the attacks, but it was obvious they hadn’t made much progress. Fireball or body slam alike, they wouldn’t get through walls that thick. It seemed the enemy noticed the same as the noise abated mere minutes after it had started and, aside from the frequent ‘pew’ of the Magic Arrows out of sight, an eerie silence descended upon the battlefield.
She could just make out the Reaper’s on the walls jumping from their positions. The roar of a Skeletal Dragon reverberated through her chest but no legend such as that had appeared over the walls. They’ve distracted them! A wave of joy flushed through her, and she could see the other soldiers around her begin to cheer up at the knowledge that the greatest threats had been dispatched of for now. Normal soldiers could take care of Skeletons and Liches, the only major threat remaining was that of the Elder Liches.
“They’re climbing the walls!” She heard someone scream, her smile was gone. If the army got over the walls, then it was over. In such a situation&mldr; She didn’t have time to finish that thought.
“Hold them off for as long as you can! Swordsmen, reposition! We’ll open the gate shortly!” The closest Commander took charge, slapping her on the back in the direction of the walls. Fear flooded into her in an instant. She’d be on the frontlines. She needed to hold them off. It was up to her. “Mages drop back!”
Steeling herself, Alice made for the walls and climbed the stairs with her heart in her hands. The mages had already retreated to the back lines, preparing for the gate to drop by the time she reached the walls. A Dwarf tapped her side and grinned at her when she turned to look at him.
“Don’t worry lass. The Centurions are the first thing they’ll see once them gates are down. It’ll take some serious force to get past them.” Alice nodded, putting up a smile just to appease him. He seemed kind enough; unlike the image she’d had of their race at least. She supposed that she might have been lied to as she grew up, that Dwarves weren’t simply beasts to be contained under-ground. If they were willing to fight on the same side, then they certainly couldn’t be as dumb as rumours seemed to believe. “All we’ve gotta do is hold the walls.”
They arrived on the open tops of those thicks stone walls shortly after and the Dwarf beside her ignited his blade.
“Fire rune.” He explained at the sight of her confusion. “Good against the undead.”
Alice looked over the walls and gasped, stumbling back slightly. She hadn’t expected those numbers. She wasn’t a general, she didn’t need to be particularly intelligent to work as a soldier, so she didn’t need to have a proper grasp on just how large an army 30,000 was. Everything past the wall was just a writhing mass of white. There was no other way to describe it. And climbing? She supposed it could be put that way, but the skeletons were hardly scaling the wall. Rather, the bones of fallen Skeletons were being stacked and clambered over, entire ladders of bones constructed by dead and undead alike as the skeletons came closer and closer to their goal.
The few mages left on the walls were shooting as many Magic Arrows as quick as they could, but it wasn’t making any difference at all. If they hit a Skeleton, they knocked out one opponent, if they hit a Lich, it was about 12 that dropped but, even then, those numbers were far too small to even faze the enemy. It just gave them more materials for their makeshift siege equipment. They needed to hit an Elder Lich but there were none in sight and certainly none close enough to aim at.
The first Skeletons had reached the top of the walls now and Dwarves and Humans alike were slashing at neck after neck, attempting to dispatch them as quickly as possible. As soon as the first made their way up, many more followed as if spurred on by the success. The ladders were pushed down but they were built back up much quicker, an ever-growing slope of bones that gradually became easier and easier for their enemies to ascend.
It was then that the stench hit her. A Skeleton had emerged from behind the wall directly in front of her, a concentrated odour of death so strong she could taste it. Swinging blindly, she managed to crack her sword into the thing’s skull, sending it flying but another replaced it before she could even take a breath. The Dwarf she had spoken with chopped through its neck in an instant and threw the body at the next on comer.
“You alright lass?” She nodded in his direction, wiping her watering eyes. The smell had knocked her off balance slightly, but she’d recovered now. There shouldn’t be a problem from now on.
“Open the gates!” There was a rumbling to one side as the solid stone gate dropped, crushing some of their enemies and leaving only the portcullis to stop the undead getting in. “Drop!”
She could hear Magic Arrows firing once more. So that had been the plan? It would take serious strength to get through the portcullis, so they used it as a shield whilst still being able to attack through it. That would certainly help against the masses of Skeletons but as soon as an Elder Lich appeared&mldr; She didn’t want to think about that.
Her sword swung again, dispatching of another of their assailants. At a quick glance, the walls seemed to be holding. They could hold this&mldr; Position&mldr; Even as she was cheering in her mind at their success, her heart plummeted. From far off to her left, a huge blast of ice, undoubtedly stray from the Skeletal Dragons, was flying through the sky towards the portcullis. Whether it had been aimed or was just an unlucky accident she didn’t know but the force of a Dragon wasn’t to be looked down upon. The second that huge block of ice slammed into the metal frame, they both shattered. The metal bent in towards the city and smaller chunks of ice, each the size of a Human’s head crashed to the floor and crushed the Skeletons there.
“They’re inside.” She breathed as the Skeletons behind those that had been crushed climbed through the new gap without hesitating. Hordes of them squeezed into the new battlefield, constantly shot down or slashed at the middle but that didn’t stop them. At the moment, the hole wasn’t big enough for a sufficient number to enter the city and overwhelm the forces but-
“Pay attention!” A man growled beside her, crushing the skull of a Skeleton that had almost tackled her from the wall. Her Dwarf friend was gone. She scanned the wall for him but all she saw was bones. Other soldiers had been distracted as well; the Skeletons had used that to their advantage and gained a foothold on the wall. The Centurions were crushing every Skeleton that came close, but she didn’t have time to watch the giant machines. Another lapse like that and she’d be dead.
Thankfully, other soldiers were already chasing the Skeletons back off the wall and those that made it past were quickly dispatched of by the mages. Alice focussed back on the edge of the wall, cutting down the Skeletons that managed to make it up to her.
Behind her however, the scene was not so quickly resolved. Unbeknownst to her, as Alice turned back towards the skeleton army the first Elder Lich had just made it through into the city.</p><h2 id=lowri-5>Lowri 5<a href=#lowri-5 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Lowri stared at her opponent, awestruck. They had successfully managed to draw the attention of their targets by releasing a huge amount of mana that they had stored into crystals over the past few days in preparation for their fight but the aura that surrounded the beast before her&mldr; She had never felt anything like it before. It felt wrong to call this thing Undead. Even the two Skeletal Dragons at its side, a formidable force in themselves, couldn’t hold a candle to the absolute might of the Skeletal Commander. Behind her, she could tell that her comrades were thinking the same. Theirs was a fighting force comprised of five Reapers and a Purple ranked Monster Hunter. A team that should’ve been able to stand up to the Seven Swords but… Even before the battle began, they knew they couldn’t oppose this foe.
There was a crack of metal on dirt and Lowri turned to see Tyler bent on one knee with his head down. He couldn’t see her, but he could feel her piercing gaze.
“Farik was right.” Where was his usual bravado? His regal, righteous act? He had been acting weird since he arrived but bowing to an enemy? Lowri had never thought she’d see the day this man bowed to anyone, much less a force of evil like the Undead. “I’d rather live on the run from the major Guilds my entire life than fight that thing.”
Before she could say anything in response, Leila and Balk had already joined him, overcome by the pressure of their foe. Lowri watched the remaining fighters carefully, but they seemed ready to carry on. Just like that, their fighting force had halved. Even those that remained standing were trembling under the Skeletal Commander’s cold, piercing glare.
“Please! If you can understand the human tongue, please listen!” Tyler cried out. The Undead glanced at him momentarily but showed no sign of responding. “We are the strongest of our race! Spare our lives and we will fight alongside you! Each of us is stronger than one of your Elder Liches; we could be of great use to you!” For a long moment, nothing happened. The Skeletal Commander’s gaze passed over each of his six opponents one by one until he settled on Lowri, the apparent leader.
“And you?” The voice the creature spoke in was unbelievably gruff but seemed strangely hollow, as though the words weren’t created the same way a human might but were artificially generated. Lowri glanced back at Roak and Rend, her only two remaining allies. “What says their ruler?” Roak tapped her on the side as he passed by, headed in the direction of Tyler.
“Don’t die too quickly; we still haven’t had our match.” At first, she thought even the great Lord Roak and his inflexible pride had succumbed to this monster, but his purpose became obvious as he closed in on Tyler, his massive hand clasping around the man’s skull. Tyler didn’t move; even if he somehow managed to shake off Roak’s beastly strength he would have raised his head towards the person, he was begging the forgiveness of. Roak lifted the Reaper up in a single palm and pointed him directly towards the Skeletal Commander as his grip strengthened. Slowly but surely, the pressure on his skull increased. Tyler attempted to scream but his voice didn’t carry to Lowri, whether that was because nothing came out or because she was focussed on finding a way out of the situation it didn’t matter. With a final, sickening crunch, he was gone from the world and Roak was left growling at his enemy. “We won’t tolerate traitors. Our job is to slow these guys down; if you can’t do that then I suggest you run before I get to you.”
Without pause, Roak made to move to Leila next. She turned and fled but was met with the firm stance of Rend. It seemed that, outsider or not, he wasn’t willing to let this go. While they were dealing with her, Balk attempted to escape as well. Unfortunately, his foot had already been tied in place by a root spell courtesy of Lowri. Reapers killing each other wasn’t something she wanted to see but it would be more dangerous to keep them alive knowing they had sided with the enemy.
“You heard him.” Lowri spoke with false confidence. The Skeletal Commander hadn’t moved once, choosing to watch over their squabble with something akin to amusement in his eyes. “We’ll fight you.”
“You’ll die.” The reports had been correct in how they described him. Undead or not, he seemed more like a human than a Lich. His eyes were too blue to be natural but, aside from his overly wrinkled skin, he could pass as just another old man. That said, this old man whipped his scimitar from side to side with more power and speed than any real human could hope to muster. Turning to his Dragons, he ordered them back to the town.
“Do you think you can take one each?” Rend and Roak looked across to her like she was crazy. That said&mldr; They were justified. “If they get back to the town it’s all over, you don’t have to beat them. Just keep them occupied until reinforcements arrive.”
Roak begrudgingly nodded to himself. One of the Dragons was already charging a breath attack but that wouldn’t stop him. He charged the huge mass of bones and landed a punch directly on its jaw, forcing the attack to go off prematurely. That should’ve reduced the damage at least slightly&mldr; Rend followed soon after, allowing Lowri to focus on her opponent.
“Have you thought this through?” She couldn’t tell due to the strange nature of his face, but he seemed to be grinning. “An army of you couldn’t defeat me.”
“We’ll see about that.” Lowri looked down at her ring and pressed the emerald embedded there.
‘It’ll take a few minutes for the spell to reach you, hold on until then.’ Ignoring the urge to scream at the voice in her head for not telling her that sooner, she simply nodded to herself. At this point, all she could do was hope that the mystery man pulled through.
“Indeed, we will.” The distance between them was crossed in an instant. Lowri was by no means weak. In terms of superiority in battle she had one of the best records for a human in recorded history. Maybe she couldn’t stand on the level of the Heroes but no-one alive could, it was unfair to hold anyone to that standard. That said, when she witnessed the speed with which that monstrosity charged her, the unparalleled force with which its feet crashed against the floor, she wished for strength for the first time in her life.
A blow to the stomach, narrowly blocked by crossing her arms, threw her across the plains. The air itself seemed to distort around her. Searing pain shot through both arms. Years ago, she remembered seeing Tyler do something fancy when he was hit with an especially powerful attack by a lizard man. He’d twirled through the air and landed in a crouch. There was no hope of that here. Her very senses had been sent haywire, unable to keep up. When Lowri hit the ground, she hit it hard, only adding to the tingling sensation running through her shoulder.
That thing’s Undead right? Scrambling to her feet, she glanced to each side, but her swords were no-where to be seen. Her attacker was well over ten metres away, opening and closing his fist rhythmically. With the obvious exception of the Skeletal Dragons’ well-balanced build, Undead were almost always physically weak, excelling at magic instead. If that thing surpassed a Reaper in physical strength to this extent, then&mldr; What kind of magic does it use? Suddenly, controlling an army 30,000 strong didn’t seem too far-fetched; it wasn’t like there weren’t Reapers that would be able to take that hit, tanks like Roak could probably absorb that and much more but the very fact that she was hurt was impressive.
Looking down, the Reaper found a very visible dent in the braces she wore. They were nothing more than two strips of leather with a thin palladium inlay, but it had served her throughout her Adventuring years. Seeing something she’d had for so long in such a state would usually infuriate her, but the pain was dulling her thoughts.
“You seem shocked.” The Skeletal Commander was already recovering the ground, taking his time. This was a game to him no doubt. She could imagine how happy he was right now. He’d lead an army into human land, the first Undead being to ever do so, only to find no challenge in taking said land. It was said Undead beings’ hatred for the living was out of their control, a primal desire to kill that fuelled them. How nice must it be to fulfil that desire?
“Sorry, I wasn’t expecting you to actually put up a fight.” She spoke through gritted teeth, dampening the pain with a spell and putting her fists up. If there was one thing she was confident in, it was her speed. He’d just caught her off guard, that was all.
“Strong words from someone who can’t even keep her feet on the floor.” Lowri glared slightly, watching her opponent as he slowly drew near. It truly was a leisurely pace, like he had no worries in the world. He shrugged slightly when she gave no other response. “You aren’t even trying to entertain me. <em>Sigh</em> Very well, let’s get this over with.”</p><h2 id=alice-2>Alice 2<a href=#alice-2 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>The Centurions sped up in their efforts as soon as the Elder Lich was spotted, as though invigorated at the sight of a powerful enemy. Giant mechanical arms tore bones apart in their attempts to gain ground. And they did, slowly but surely, they pushed forward against the mass of bone.
As soon as the Centurions reached the Elder Lich, three split off to deal with it as the remainder continued their massacre. Separating the undead from their master, they immediately began to pound on its shield, shattering the spell in seconds. Fireballs flew off in all directions, but the mechanical bodies tanked the attacks. Centurions weren’t particularly powerful when compared to an Elder Lich, but these machines had been the Dwarves’ first line of defence for hundreds of years. Even if they were only a fraction of the power of an Elder Lich, they had been especially designed to overcome that with resistances to match. The Elder Lich was crushed beneath a flurry of blows before it could deal any serious damage.
The Humans and Dwarves on the walls cheered as they watched a small chunk of the army dropped, buried underfoot by what had once been their allies. Victory finally seemed feasible. All they had to do was hold off the army until the Centurions destroyed the Elder Liches. Alice, despite her burning limbs, hadn’t taken a hit yet and threw her arms into the air in cheer before slicing through another Skeleton’s chest. A Lich had reached the wall shortly before but, magic or not, it was pushed back almost immediately. If the enemy maintained this tactic&mldr; We’ll wi- A scream cut her off.
The earth groaned beneath them, a low, rumbling noise that seemed to shake her very bones. What was that? It felt like an earthquake. She saw fear on the faces around her. The Dwarf that had growled at her not so long ago for not paying attention had stopped dead in his tracks the second he turned to look for the cause of that noise. His face was a picture of perfect horror. More and more screams rose up behind them as&mldr; Whatever it was&mldr; Tore through rank after rank of soldiers.
She slapped the Dwarf’s face, attempting to shock him back to his senses. No reaction. He didn’t even move. There was no hope trying to save him. Alice focussed her efforts back on the Skeletons, kicking down a newly constructed ladder before it could be used. Don’t look back. Don’t look back. Don’t look back. She repeated that phrase like a mantra. In seconds, their fighting force had halved, every soldier that had looked at that thing had stopped in their tracks. Those that were still going were all thinking the exact same thing. Like children hiding from the monsters under their bed, they ran away. It wasn’t something they could defeat. The only option was to stay out of its way. The Undead army hadn’t managed to deal as much damage in nearly twenty minutes as that thing had done in seconds so the answer obvious, right? If their chances were better against the army then they had to kill everything heading their way. Maybe then, by some miracle, they might be able to escape it.
She was crying now. The telltale sound of firebolts behind her told her that more Elder Liches had crawled their way in. This had been the signal they were waiting for. Everything up until now was a farce designed to keep them still until help arrived. Wait. Wasn’t that our plan? Hadn’t they intended to do the same? They were Undead; they can’t plan, they can’t make strategies. Wasn’t that the weakness of the Undead? But then&mldr; What weakness was there?
The realisation had finally dawned upon her. Everyone had seemed quiet before the battle; maybe that was because, deep down, they already knew what this was; a final stand. Was she, was she really going to die here? Would she burn up in one of those fireballs? Or have her stomach slit by a Skeleton? Or would she be killed by that thing? She wondered, would she have the strength to look at it? Even in death would she turn her eyes away?
She wiped away her tears. She could barely even raise her arms anymore. The effort of swinging around a sword was beginning to get the better of her. She was so tired. Another swing and another enemy fell. It was slower now. She was slowing down. She knew she was. Her eyes were still misty, vision distorted. This was it. What could a regular foot-soldier do in a situation like this?
Another slice. And another. With each time she picked up her sword to crack it against a Skeleton’s head or cut through their vertebrae, it became harder to do it again until, finally, the weapon clattered from her grasp. A Skeleton tackled her from the wall. Crack. Alice’s head hit the floor, but her body seemed to be resting on something squishy. The Skeleton hadn’t been so lucky, its body falling apart from the impact. What had she landed on? One look at her red hands answered that question. Get up. Her brain wasn’t working properly. Get up! No matter how hard she tried, her limbs wouldn’t move as she asked. Consciousness was quickly escaping her. Her head was hot, covered in some warm sticky liquid even as her body slowly grew cold and then&mldr; The world faded away.</p><p>Throughout her life, Alice had never believed in the Gods. It was hard to think of such things when she had seen so many Undead throughout her time as an Adventurer. What Gods with their mighty plan wouldn’t allow good people to rest even once they had died? Death was the end of your fight. Once you died, all the problems you had in your life die along with you. Alice hated the Undead not because they were evil but because they defied that belief; proof of an unjust God. Spawned Undead like the army she had fought against were a natural occurrence, she couldn’t argue with that but the fact that they would bring back even the best of people, corrupt their minds and force them to fight and kill their own families and friends&mldr; That she couldn’t forgive.
Perhaps that was why, when she stood up, she felt an unbelievable hatred for the living yes but even more than that, the creature in front of her filled her with a fury beyond anything she had ever felt. He hadn’t cast a mind control spell on her and her mind had yet to cave into the crushing hatred for the living. Maybe this was her final stand. An act of defiance before she was consumed by undeath. If she hated the Undead then that thing, that monster that led them, maybe it was her job to eliminate it. No thought went behind her actions when she kicked off the ground, just an urge to kill the thing that had brought her to this state before it could do so once more.
“Oh, scary&mldr;” The Skeletal Commander stopped her with a single hand, grasping her by the forehead; he was probably frowning but she couldn’t properly tell. Her mind was too clouded to properly understand what was happening. “This one’s still sane? Is she that mentally strong?” He cocked his head to one side, examining her blood-stained face. “I turned you right? Did you die too close to when I used the spell? I’m sure I left enough time though&mldr; Ah, no, I get it.” He brought his face even closer, he was grinning. “To think a specimen like you could exist, really, you humans continue to surprise even after thousands of years of life. I knew you were a ridiculous race but to overcome the urge to kill the living simply by hating something else, that’s almost stupid enough to be admirable.”
“Argh-” She tried to argue, to get closer, and to hit him, even once. Nothing worked. She was just writhing in his grip and released a strange, gargling noise.
“You really are scary. An Undead that’s overcome her hatred for the living, an endless life to grow stronger in. Given enough time you might even be able to challenge me.” His expression truly did have a hint of fear, even if it was hidden under his glee. “It’s a shame that that emotion had to be a want to murder me of all things, maybe if you had been able to act like a normal Undead you could’ve gotten away. No, I think I’ll have to kill you before you get that chance.”
His hand tightened so casually, so effortlessly, so then how? How could such little effort result in such a tremendous pain? How could a human skull be crushed so easily? Finally, perhaps slightly later than she had expected, Alice said goodbye to the world for good.</p><h2 id=lowri-6>Lowri 6<a href=#lowri-6 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><em>10 minutes earlier</em>
When is he gonna get here!? Resisting the urge to scream, Lowri took another hit to her forearms. She’d been dodging and blocking for what felt like an eternity, incapable of getting a hit in. Her hopes had been placed on the mystery man that contacted her and yet he showed no signs of arriving. He said a few minutes! How has it not been a few minutes yet!? The Skeletal Commander had found it fun to beat her this way at first, the knowledge that she couldn’t fight back, even when he didn’t use magic, was amusing to him. But he seemed to be growing gradually more and more annoyed by her perseverance, cheer switching to boredom to irritation to annoyance. If it kept up like his, he might switch to using magic just to finish her off quickly.
Behind him, Rend and Roak seemed to be faring much better than expected as well. They were gradually being whittled down due to a lack of stamina but, as they both specialised in physical power, they seemed capable enough to distract their respective opponents for at least as long as she could. But she knew, they knew, it would only take one attack, one missed block&mldr; No doubt that would be their end.
“Awfully persistent, are you not?” The Commander spoke through gritted teeth as he punched again. Lowri ducked to the side, narrowly dodging a hit to the face. “To think that there’s a Human that can keep up with me in physical combat. It’s sickening.”
Another punch. Blocked. Her braces no longer resembled a form of armour. They had been beaten to the shape of his fists, as though he was intentionally punching the same places over and over and over. ‘30 seconds.’ The voice spoke in her mind.
“Was that hope?” The Skeletal Commander chuckled slightly. “Have you really been drawing out this battle because you think that help is going to arrive and save you? You realise what is happening inside of that town, right? That my Abomination is tearing apart your soldiers as we speak?” She ignored his taunts. She had long since realised that they were missing a vital opponent in this fight. Letting that faze her now when she was so close to a possible victory would be idiocy.
“Who’s to say that’s the help I was waiting for?” It paused slightly, frowning at her.
“There’s no one I can sense that might be capable of fighting me, unless you’re saying that someone has fooled my senses you must be expecting help from someone many, many miles away. You think someone will teleport that distance and come to help you? Even I would be tired after making that trip.” Lowri didn’t falter which only worsened his mood. “Very well, if you’re that insistent that this person exists then I’ll just have to kill you before they get here.”
The moment those words left the monster’s mouth, the two Dragons behind him sped up, their movements unbelievably quick for something of their size. Not just that but their breath attacks grew colder and the area they effected seemed to increase. In a matter of seconds, Rend had already been caught; his left leg froze into place. ‘20 seconds.’
20 seconds. Could she last 20 seconds? She had to. The Skeletal Commander stepped back slightly and stretched his hand out towards her chest. He was too far away to touch her, but her heart rate increased drastically just from that simple action. Lowri had heard of this spell. She was usually immune to instant-death spells but if it was something this high-level&mldr;
“Grasp Heart.” He called. Her heart twinged slightly, a sharp pain spreading through her chest. It felt like someone had reached inside of her, their hand cupping the organ with unparalleled care. Suddenly, she couldn’t feel so certain of herself anymore. Even ignoring her relative strength, her ability to negate instant-death spells was incredibly rare, it was one of the main reasons she had been given the title of Reaper; it allowed her to negate an entire field of magic. Yet, right now, as Lowri felt those slender, bony fingers wrap around her heart, she couldn’t help but doubt her own power. ‘15 seconds.’
Can you hurry up!? She shrieked mentally, a cry of desperation. Suddenly, his fingers were tightening. A noise escaped her, like all the air in her escaped at once. Lowri watched as her opponent’s out-stretched hand curled into a fist, the pressure on her heart gradually increasing until it burst. Her brain was still working. For just a couple of seconds after that intense pressure, she could still feel the blood pumping around her body, still feel the cold wind on her face&mldr; Then her knees had hit the floor and her face shortly after.
All the strength in her body was gone. There was nothing she could do. ’10 sec-Ah&mldr;’ The voice slowly faded away as her brain tried desperately to find a way out of this situation. Nothing. No thoughts. Nothing ordered enough to be considered a thought at least. But even that chaos was slowly fading. It probably happened in just a couple of seconds but to her it felt likes years were passing. ‘I’ll give you a choice. Live or die.’ One voice pierced through it all. She wanted to live, of course she did but how could she escape from this. No, there was no way. No matter who that mystery man was, he couldn’t save her now. The cold embrace of death was already smothering her. ‘Live or die.’ The same phrase repeated in her mind. I&mldr; I want-. Even if it was pointless, she wanted to hope. Lowri still had decades ahead of her, she was still convinced of that. After all the effort she had put into becoming a Lady, how could she die only a couple years after gaining her land?
‘I want to live.’
‘I see.’ Then the world went black.</p><h2 id=rufus>Rufus<a href=#rufus class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>“Let’s hope I do this right&mldr;” It had been decades since I had read anything even remotely related to Necromancy and, even then, it had been much too low level a spell to maintain the target’s conscious. “Rise.” As soon as the spell was cast, I began to pump mana into the corpse both to heal her, quite literally, broken heart and help speed along the process of resurrection.
The woman seemed to be in her late thirties, around the same age I had been when I turned but the difference in power between what I had started as and her current state was obvious; even without my intervention, it could have taken years for her body to break down with all the mana that surrounded her. That was probably a blessing in disguise, even if I failed the first time, I’d likely be able to try to bring her back quite a few times before it began to majorly affect her body. She had been dead for less than a minute and it showed, on the outside at least, she looked completely normal, if somewhat battered and bruised.
Her eyelids fluttered open a few seconds after the spell was cast, light returning to her eyes. It seemed I had revived her in time to keep at least some of her personality because she didn’t immediately jump up looking for something to kill. Instead, she stayed where she lay, staring up at the visor I had donned.
“Rufus?” Her words were slurred and seemed to run over one another, but they made enough sense to be interpreted.
“I suppose I am.” I responded, propping her up beside me. Though we’d spoken a few times now, seeing her was a different matter entirely. She was fit as any Adventurer should be and, under the bruises that had begun to form pre-death, it was obvious she had once taken great care of her appearance. In her prime, she must’ve been something to behold; a Valkyrie.
“Where are we?” She still didn’t have enough strength to support herself, so I allowed her to lean against my shoulder. We were currently in the back of my carriage. It wasn’t too lavishly decorated but it would seem strange if the saviour of a country didn’t have any riches, so I had splashed just enough to maintain appearances if someone saw inside.
“We’re about halfway around the mapped world from where you were.” I responded calmly. “I teleported you here using that ring.” She glanced down slightly and her head lolled forwards from the action. I quickly helped her back up and this time she remained in place. “You were in quite a state when you arrived, what happened?” It seemed her memories had come back to her now.
“I&mldr; I died&mldr;” She grasped her chest, scared. “How am I alive?” Now the question was whether to tell her the truth or not&mldr; The ring I had given her suppressed anger so, if she kept it on, she wouldn’t lose herself and, with the amount of mana hanging around her, she likely wouldn’t realise any physical changes for at least a few years. I had even started her heart back up, so she was technically alive, like a half-Undead. Dependent upon what affect that had, she might never notice&mldr;
“I brought you back to life.” No, no matter how I thought about it, if I lied it would just come back to bite me. I lifted the visor off my head and showed her my real face. “I’m Undead.” The remnants of my human self recoiled at finally admitting that to someone, a tiny bit of shame rising in my chest before quickly being suppressed.
“You’re&mldr;” She faltered slightly; it wasn’t fear, perhaps she had run out of that. Rather, she seemed to be trying to think the situation through. “I’m Undead? But I don’t feel any hatred. I can think?”
“I figured you might die before I could save you. That ring I gave you has a second function, as long as you don’t grow strong enough to threaten to me, it’ll suppress your hatred for the living to a bearable degree.”
“I see.” She bit her lip. “So, I’m allowed to live until I become a threat?” I nodded slightly. “Why me?”
“I needed the leader of the Northern Hills to be able to regain control of the area once I destroy that army.”
“I’m not the leader.” She spat. “We were equals. I haven’t earnt any title higher than that.”
“Yes, well…” I remained silent for a moment. She was unexpectedly stubborn on this point. “You were the one called upon to lead the army. When we save the Northern Hills, they’ll need a figure to unite behind; you’ll be returning as it’s Queen. Feel free to do whatever is necessary to convince yourself you deserve that.”
Silence. For a long time. I turned to face her but quickly looked away upon realising she was crying. Instead, my gaze landed on the flower in the glass box on my lap. I was still somewhat surprised I’d brought it. No, I couldn’t leave it. Even though…
“You had the power, you could’ve teleported there.” She whispered. “If you could bring me here, you could’ve come, you could’ve helped us.”
“Transporting you this distance has drained me. It’ll take days for me to recover fully. Had I teleported to the battlefield, I would’ve died alongside you.” I hesitated. “You know even better than I do… That battle was hopeless. Necessary. But hopeless.”
She grimaced and then, unable to find another way release the emotion, punched me. It was weak and, in doing so, she flopped forwards slightly, still unable to properly support her weight. I helped right her but didn’t say anything.
“I thought you were coming to help, I thought if I could just hold him off then you’d show up and you’d save the country.” Her eyes pierced him. “That’s what you are right? You’re supposed to be the Hero, aren’t you? You saved Withral! What’s so diff-”
“Lowri. I need to stay alive; that’s my first duty. I can’t protect everyone, I’m not strong enough. Doing what you’re asking would result in many more deaths in the-” My gaze was still focused on that flower.
“Fuck the long run! You’ve been nothing but politics since we started talking! Can you at least look at me whilst you excuse yourself for abandoning my comrades!? Is a flower so interesting you can avert your eyes to the lives you’ve ended?”
“Lowri!” For an instant, I felt. Anger, loss, frustration. Emotions I thought I’d already lost or buried a long time ago. What did she know? What could she possibly know about this? I stared at her as she had asked, my dead blue eyes burying into hers. “There are some battles you cannot win. We take our time, we grow stronger, we do what is necessary. You don’t win an impossible battle; you make the battle winnable. That is what makes a Hero.
“I don’t care about your honour, I don’t care about your humanity, I don’t care if you think you deserve this. It is your right to be angry, to be sad and you have the right to blame me. But it is your duty to take back your home.” I paused. “And, if you do as I say, that’s what you’ll do.”</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=/dennis-site/posts/setup-helloworld/ class="button inline next">[<span class=button__text>Project 1: Setting up the website</span>] ></a></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
