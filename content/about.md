## ABOUT

Hi, I'm a uni student with a lot of free time on my hands and a lot of stuff I wanna do
This website's here primarily as a way for my friends and colleagues to surf through the projects I work on a lot easier
Primarily, I'll be posting art and writing but I worked on a lot of different stuff so we'll see what ends up going up

### Tags

Generally, I'll be attempting to stick to the following tags:

Art - Any drawings, whittling or crotchet I do

Essays - An essay about a topic, for example: a trope, a book series etc

Games - Any tabletop games or coded games I work on

Longer fiction - These will have their own tags which will be the series title

One shot - Any story that is told in one installment

Poems - Self explanatory

Other - This will be anything not encapsulated in the above tags, for example, a cookbook

### Current projects

This website

A TTRPG system based on Hunter x Hunter

Two chapters of a story

A large drawing which I'm hoping will become my first large tattoo once finished
