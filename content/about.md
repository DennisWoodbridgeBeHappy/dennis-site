## ABOUT

Hi, I'm a uni student with a lot of free time on my hands and a lot of stuff I wanna do
This website's here primarily as a way for my friends and colleagues to surf through the projects I work on a lot easier
Primarily, I'll be posting art and writing but I worked on a lot of different stuff so we'll see what ends up going up

### Tags

Generally, I'll be attempting to stick to the following tags:

1. Art - Any drawings, whittling or crotchet I do
2. Essays - An essay about a topic, for example: a trope, a book series etc
3. Games - Any tabletop games or coded games I work on
4. Longer fiction - These will have their own tags which will be the series title
5. One shot - Any story that is told in one installment
6. Poems - Self explanatory
7. Other - This will be anything not encapsulated in the above tags, for example, a cookbook

### Current projects

1. This website
2. A TTRPG system based on Hunter x Hunter
3. Two chapters of a story
4. Art for a logo for my father's business idea
5. A large drawing which I'm hoping will become my first large tattoo once finished
6. Cookbook
