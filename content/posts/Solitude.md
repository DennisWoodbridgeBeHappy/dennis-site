A bar this time, old-fashioned but still younger than the man sat at it. He must’ve been getting into his 60’s now, patches of grey hair hung desperately from his loosening skin. There was a drink in his hand, but Adam didn’t know enough about alcohol to identify it. The man called him over, the wave of his hand causing his overcoat to ruffle slightly, the only noise in what should’ve been an active bar. 

Noir. That was the word that came to mind. He remembered Felix talking about some old detective movies that fell under that title. This scene seemed much more desperate however, an old man clinging onto the detective movies he’d loved as a young man even as he slowly forgot their structure, their characters, their story. The walls looked about ready to cave in, perhaps he was even beginning to forget the setting itself.

Adam sat beside him and a drink appeared in his hand. There was no bartender and none of the drinks behind the counter had poured themselves into a glass, it was simply there. He hadn’t even realised his hand had been ready to receive a glass until it was there. No, it hadn’t been, his hand had been at his side, he was sure of-

“Drink.” The man spoke, his voice like gravel in Adam’s ears. He hesitated but brought the drink to his lips. It was like acid in his mouth, burning all the way down but he fought against the urge to cough it back up. Even as he put the glass back down, he could see it refilling. “Name.”

“Adam.” His eyes were pinched shut and his fingers rapped against his thigh as he waited for the sensation to pass. The man didn’t offer his name in return. “What do I have to do to leave?” 

The man took a sip of his drink. Adam couldn’t properly make out his face, even now they were just a few tens of centimetres apart. That long, grey, wispy hair, somehow always covered just enough to prevent him piecing it together.

“You’re lucky.” The man spoke slowly. “To be as young as you are. Men like me, we’d do just about anything to get that time back. And yet you’re here, so far from safety. I gotta wonder if you even understand the value of your own life.”

“You think I’ll die?” The man took another sip of his drink.

“If you continue south you will die. No think about it. Then again, at this point, heading back north’ll probably do you in just as good. You think I’m here for the fun of it?” 

“So, you came from the equator too? How old were you?”

“Older than you. Lot older than you. Musta been in my 40’s, I don’t know, that was a long while ago now. All but given up at that point, figured I might as well get some adventure in me before I kicked it.” The volume in his glass didn’t seem to go down no matter how much he drank from it. The ice never melted. The dust would always return to the same spots. It was like he was watching a doll on loop, order to pretend to drink and then forgotten here.

“Pretty early to be thinking about dying.” Adam didn’t bother asking why the man had stopped travelling here; there was no point to it.

“Yeah, well you don’t know nothing about being that age yet. If you did you wouldn’t be so sure of yourself.” Another drink. “You might not have noticed it yet but you’re in a race against time kid. Entropy. You’re gonna go on another few years thinking you’re untouchable, nothing can go wrong, maybe even you’ll finish your trip south and return home; live happily ever after. But, little by little, bit by bit, things around you are gonna stop working the way they should. Your mind won’t be as sharp, your legs won’t be as quick, memories will grow further, presents you’ve treasured your whole life will break down.

“Scariest thing is you won’t even notice when it starts. Someday, probably a lot sooner than you think, entropy’ll win, and it’ll take you a year, two, might even take you a decade to realise it. And then you’ll start thinking. All those plans you made, the dreams you had; how many are you actually gonna have time for? You gotta work remember. That girl you like needs attention, those kids need food, and you need the drink to keep you sane enough to keep working but, of course, you gotta work even harder if you wanna afford the drink. And then, maybe 20 years from now, you’ll realise you ain’t even you anymore.

“All the tiny concessions, the promises you gotta keep, the people that expect your help, the extra time it takes to get up and go to sleep. It builds up, feeds off your very being, grows and grows until it’s eaten everything you’ve got to give.” Adam didn’t respond for a long time after that. Perfect silence descended upon them for what seemed like an eternity.

“So, you ran away huh?” The man grunted in response. “No people this far south to take up your time. No promises to keep. No help to give…”

Adam imagined he could finally see the face hiding behind that curtain of hair. Settled into a constant frown, cheeks sagging at the sides, eyes fixed on his drink, seeing nothing else.

“I feel sorry for you.” The man choked on his drink and his fringe parted just enough for Adam to catch a glare sent his way.

“I don’t need your-”

“You don’t seem to need much of anything, huh? Don’t need your friends, your family, don’t even need your adventure as an excuse to escape it anymore. I’m sure you’re perfectly happy to keep living in this memory for the rest of your life.” No response this time. “You talk about everyone you’ve ever known as if their weights dragging you down and yet you’re the one who decided to live your life with them. You chose those obligations because you found joy in them, they excited you, gave you reason and yet, the second you realised how small you are, the instant you realised you’d die someday, everything in your life became a pick, chipping away at the time you had left piece by piece. You didn’t lose to entropy, you lost to your own fear, you let it consume every relationship, every memory you’ve ever had.”

“What could you know? You’ve never experienced it, you can only say that-”

“Because I’m young? Because I don’t realise how little time I’ve got left? Because I think I’m untouchable?” The man refused to meet his gaze. “And yet which of us do you think is happier?” 

Adam took the glass in his hand, put it to his lips and tipped it completely upside down, draining the contents in one gulp. Some of it poured down his cheeks and his throat burnt desperately as it tried to keep the drink down. He slammed the glass onto the counter, still upside down, still empty and clenched his fists, eyes watering, until the sensation passed.

“You’ve spent the last 20 years trapped in a vision of your past, thinking about your future, and refusing to live in the present. You’ve spent so much time fearing death that you haven’t realised you’ve already died.” He paused for breath. “I have no intention of joining you here for eternity; I have people I want to meet, things I want to do. Frankly, I don’t care if I’ll meet my goals or reach my dreams, I don’t care if I die without accomplishing anything, I’m going to keep heading south because it’s what I want to do. I’ll think about ‘can’ or ‘can’t’ when I’m dead.”

He walked back to the exit, placed a hand on the door and then turned back to the man. He looked so small sat there, lost and alone, adrift in a world that didn’t care for him and too weak to find purpose within himself. “Your adventure is over, go back to your family and spend the rest of your life making amends. It’ll take me another few months to reach the south and get back here, if you haven’t left by then… I’ll put you out of your misery myself.”
