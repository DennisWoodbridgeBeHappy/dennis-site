## Mission Statement

The goal of this document is to create a system for a Hunter x Hunter (here on referred to as hxh) based TTRPG. It will need to outline rules for:
* Creating player, non-player characters and animals
* Social interactions, fights, rests and travel
* Tools and human on object interactions
* Character progression and training
* Nen abilities (including Nen beasts)
* Basic scaling for weapons and abilities
The goal is not to create a system that explains everything in hxh, for example I will not aim to incorporate Killua’s assassin skills into the system. It will also not aim to expand upon the hxh universe. That said, it should provide a basis upon which other people can easily build both of those things.
I should also state the following ahead of time, I will be attempting to create a system:
* In which, whilst combat is fun, it is punishing as I feel this is in spirit with how hxh was written
* That is decently heavily reliant on role playing from the actual players
* That is very fluid 
  * HxH’s power system deliberately allows characters to break any rule if they make restrictions or sacrifices big enough, so every rule mentioned always has the “unless otherwise stated” proviso

## Game Master

Whilst the GM (or GMs) will likely control the great majority of the characters involved in a campaign, the campaign itself is a joint venture and should be treated as such. The abilities that player characters gain, whilst likely thought up by the player will be decided upon and balanced by the whole team, including the GM. Specialist Nen users especially are incredibly tricky to balance and it’s important that the decision doesn’t go to just one voice and that revisions are made if necessary. First and foremost, the system is a story-telling tool and, as such, anything that ruins the fun of the game should be revised or removed.
The GM’s role is to challenge the players with roleplay and puzzles without creating enemies to directly exploit the weaknesses of the team. Keeping in spirit with HxH, enemies should rely on mystery, not hard counters. Fighting should be an unfortunate consequence of the story, not a go to method of resolution; it cannot be stressed enough, the more complex a Nen ability, the more characters should be punished for revealing too much unnecessarily and the more they should be rewarded for hiding them in story. 
Due to how complex the interactions between Nen users can be, I have taken every effort to make combat run as smoothly and quickly as possible. It is still recommended to play with 4 players per GM at an absolute max however to prevent players from growing bored.

## The Board

The board will consist of a grid of ‘spaces’ that are each deemed to be 5 feet away from one another. Occupying a space means that you stand at the centre of that space and are 5 feet away from the centre of any adjacent space. The grid can be square or hexagonal dependent upon preference. In the case that a grid is not available and something like a whiteboard is being used, just make sure that distances are consistently applied; an ability being out of range of use but looking like it should be in range can frustrate players.
Typically, creatures will occupy one full space and cannot overlap unless grappling. The exceptions to this rule are as follows:
* One small (< 1 foot) creature and one medium (< 10 foot) creature can occupy the same space simultaneously
* Up to 5 small creatures can occupy the same space simultaneously
* Large creatures occupy 4 spaces on a square grid or 3 on a hexagonal grid
* Very large creatures occupy 9 spaces on a square grid or 7 on a hexagonal grid
Large and very large creatures will be identified as such by their stat blocks as this can vary greatly depending upon body shape. Humanoid creatures however will be large if they are < 20 foot tall and very large if they are < 30 foot tall. For creatures larger than this, the GM is free to extrapolate.
When dealing with grids, if the centre of a space is within the area of effect, then the entire space and all creatures in it are deemed within the area of effect.
If you aren’t using a grid, then a creature is deemed to be within the area of effect if any part of the creature is within the area of effect.
If an ability specifies it targets a specific body part, then check if that body part specifically is in the area (for example, a sword cannot be aimed at the head of a giraffe if you stand behind the giraffe).

## The Pieces

Each character will need a piece to represent them on the board, several d6’s (roughly 5 should suffice most purposes) and tokens to represent any items or people they may control (assuming they are a Manipulator). The GM will need tokens to represent any characters they control and, likely, a greater number of d6’s (10 to 15). It’s also helpful for people to bring various shapes of differing sizes that correspond to the areas of effect of their abilities as this will make determining the outcomes of abilities much easier.
The game board will the consist of a grid or some form of visual representation of the playable space (as described in “The Board”) for each encounter including various obstacles, buildings and other such objects relevant to the encounter. A general rule should be, anything that can be used by or against a player should be either:
* Clearly represented (tables may be drawn down) or,
* Easily located based on assumptions (you don’t have to have a token for each glass bottle in the room but if a player is next to a bar, they can likely pick one up and hit someone with it)

## Character Sheet & Abilities

### Stats

The four main stats that determine a character’s awareness of and ability to manipulate their environment are your primary stats; Dexterity, Strength, Perception and Speed as described below:
* Dexterity – Specialities: Attack, Dodge, Finesse, Stealth
* Strength – Specialities: Attack, Block, Grapple, Shove
* Perception – Specialities: Attack, Hearing, Sight, Smell
* Speed – Specialties: Initiative, Escape, Travel
Each primary stat maxes out at 5 unless otherwise specified (for example, you might use a Nen restriction to increase the upper limit of your strength).
You may also earn a specialty in subsections of these skills based on your backstory and character or levelling up, each specialty will result in an additional +1 modifier to any checks involving that skill when relevant. You can have up to a +2 modifier for each specialty (separate from the modifier for the skill, leading to a total max of +7).
The specialties are used in contests as follows:
* Dexterity (Attack) – Used to attack with light weapons
* Dexterity (Dodge) – Used to dodge attacks
* Dexterity (Finesse) – Used for sleight of hand, lockpicking, pickpocketing etc
* Dexterity (Stealth) – Used for hiding
* Strength (Attack) – Used to attack with heavy weapons
* Strength (Block) – Used to block attacks
* Strength (Grapple) – Used to inflict Grappled to someone within touching distance
* Strength (Shove) – Used to inflict Prone to someone within touching distance
* Perception (Attack) – Used to attack enemies from afar
* Perception (Hearing) – Used to detect nearby noises
* Perception (Sight) – Used to check surroundings visually
* Perception (Smell) – Used to detect nearby smells
* Speed (Initiative) – Used to get a head start in combat
* Speed (Combat) – Used to determine combat movement speed
* Speed (Travel) – Used to determine travel speed
Speed will be discussed further in “Speed”.
Any ability may also call for the use of any of these specialties for whatever purpose if it is relevant to the ability.
In addition, there are the secondary stats; HP, EP, NP and touching and hitting range as described below:
* HP, this determines how many hits you can take. Each time you are hit, you will take a certain amount of damage to your HP which will require medicine, healing Nen or rests to recover. When your HP drops below 0, you are downed
* Nen points, these determine how many of your Nen abilities you can use and will generally be recovered by resting. Each Nen ability will have a cost corresponding to its level (it’s level will be determined through group discussion)
* Energy Points (EP) determines how many actions you can complete in a normal round of combat. Unless stated otherwise (such as with cool-down and wind-up abilities), your EP will refill at the end of each round of combat. Characters will have a maximum of 4 EP unless stated otherwise.
* Touching and hitting range are discussed in “Range” 
* Hearing, sight and smell ranges are discussed in “Perception Range” (all 30/60 ft unless stated otherwise)
  * The first number is a closer boundary, here you can detect smells, noises and sights that you would usually miss from further away
  * The second number is the extent of your senses, past this point you can sense nothing unless your environs adjust your senses (for example, if you’re downwind)
Players will be expected to manage their HP, NP and EP throughout combat and act accordingly as either reducing to 0 can have large consequences.
Clear absences from the stats are social and intelligence focused skills. Please refer to “Professions” for an explanation as to this.

### Range

Touching range for a character is dependent upon size as follows:
* < 1 foot, touching range is 0 spaces (0 feet); they must occupy the same space as another character to touch them
* < 10 feet, touching range is 1 space (5 feet); they must occupy the same space or be directly adjacent to another character to touch them
* From then on it scales linearly unless otherwise stated (1 extra space for every 10 feet in height). This may differ for quadrupedal animals in particular which don’t have arms to extend into other spaces, your GM will know the touching range of all animals and enemies in combat but, in the great majority of cases, it will be 1 space
Melee range will typically be equal to your touching range unless otherwise stated – very and extremely heavy melee weapons, whilst usually inflicting “encumbered”, will likely increase your melee range (this will be stated on the weapon). Even if you carry a melee weapon that extends your melee range, it must be noted this is exclusive to that weapon; your touching range remains the same (i.e. if melee range is 2 spaces and touching range is 1 space, you still have to be directly adjacent to another character to use the aid action unless you can reasonably argue your weapon would help, such as in a threat).
When using a ranged weapon or ranged Nen ability, you will be provided with an effective range for the weapon or ability. This will not be added to your touching range; the range given with the weapon is the effective range unless an ability directly states otherwise.
* If an effective range has one number, then the ability can target anything within that radius
* If an effective range has two numbers, then the ability can target anything between these two radii
Manipulation abilities may result in a single character having multiple touching ranges surrounding any number of items on the board at one time (for example, a manipulator may control dolls that can use the aid sub-action). Any Nen infused item with abilities such as this should be represented on the board during encounters.

### Speed

Speed is typically an incredibly important aspect of combat in hxh, it, hiding and Nen abilities are typically the deciding factors in any combat. Each character will have 2 speeds:
* Combat speed: This is the speed you use during non-travel encounters; your character will typically be better rested and thus you can expect this to be faster of the two speeds. This speed can be doubled by repeatedly using the Dash action, allowing easier escape from encounters. This speed will be in feet / round
  * Unless otherwise stated, your combat speed = Speed (Combat) * 5 feet / round
* Travel speed: This is the speed you use in travel encounters, including when an enemy is in pursuit of you after escaping a combat encounter. This speed will typically be slower than your combat speed and will vary based on the environment and any riding animals or vehicles you have access to. This speed will be in miles / hour
  * Unless otherwise stated, your travel speed on foot = Speed (Travel) + 2 m/h 
Your GM may also decide (at their discretion) that a profession you hold will permanently boost either of these two figures.
Your combat speed will determine if you are able to run from an encounter, but your travel speed will determine if you are able to stay out of it:
* When your combat and travel speeds >= your opponents: 
  * You can escape the encounter whenever you decide to, if you are not within 5 feet of your opponent
  * Your opponent will then not be able to catch back up with you in another location to begin the encounter again
* When your combat speed >= your opponent’s, but your opponent’s travel speed is >= yours: 
  * You can escape any encounter whenever you decide to, if you are not within 5 feet of your opponent
  * You will be allowed to pick an arena for your battle (perhaps even one that you set up in advance) but your opponent will decide whether to follow you to it
  * This arena must be within 8 hours travel
* When your combat speed < your opponent’s, but your travel speed is higher:
  * You may only escape an encounter if the opponent is preoccupied or allows you to (for example, pinning the opponent under rubble temporarily)
  * Once you escape the encounter, the opponent will not be able to catch back up to start another encounter
* When both your speeds are < your opponent’s:
  * You may only escape an encounter if the opponent is preoccupied or allows you to (for example, pinning the opponent under rubble temporarily)
  * Even if you escape an encounter, your opponent can catch up to you at any time and choose an arena anywhere in the direction you run
In cases where there are choke points through which you must travel to escape the encounter (for example, a building or an alley) you must first escape that area before running from the encounter. This is to prevent situations where you somehow run from an enemy you had no chance of escaping (you might be faster than an enemy but if they’re blocking the only exit, that doesn’t matter much).
In cases where there is a group of pursuers and a group that is pursued, the travel speed used is the lowest of each group. If this results in an undesirable outcome (for example, if the pursuer groups’ speed is too low to catch up to the pursued) the group may decide to leave an ally behind to increase their travel speed.

### Perception Range

Perception ranges have two values (X/Y ft):
* X is a closer boundary, here you can detect smells, noises and sights that you would usually miss from further away
* Y is the extent of your senses, past this point you can sense nothing unless your environs adjust your senses (for example, if you’re downwind)
Unless stated otherwise, perception ranges are calculated as follows:
* X = corresponding perception modifier * 5 ft + 15 ft
* Y = 2X

### Nen

Nen abilities will shape your character and what you are capable of more than any other decision throughout the entire game. They should be given great thought before choosing.

#### Gaining Nen

Provided characters haven’t already unlocked Nen prior to the start of the campaign, they will go through a similar process to what is described in the anime and manga. First, Nen will be unlocked through a month-long training time skip and then their Nen type will be determined with a glass of water and a leaf as follows:
* Enhancement – Volume of water increases
* Transmutation – Taste of water changes
* Conjuration – Object / substance appears in the water
* Specialisation – Something else happens
* Manipulation – The leaf moves
* Emission – Colour of water changes
In actual fact, the type of Nen your character uses will have been determined in a group discussion prior, but I think it’s nice to still act out the scene.
I think Initiation shouldn’t be used deliberately because it’ll basically kill half your group if it’s done faithfully but, in such a case where a character has been hit with Nen prior to learning it (but didn’t go out of their way to be so) it’s nice to have the option. In cases such as these, refer to “Initiation”.

##### Initiation

When attacking a non-Nen user or a Nen user with Zetsu active, all Nen is invisible and thus counts as a Hidden attack. 
If a non-Nen user takes more than half of their HP in damage as the result of Nen attack, then they will awaken to Nen over the course of the next 3 days. Without proper coaching during this process however, they will burn themselves out and die due to a lack of control over their own Nen. Some geniuses may survive this but that isn’t something your players should rely on, so I won’t add a method to determine this for the actual game. Instead, this should be used as a plot point to set up a big bad or something of the like.

#### Nen types

It’s important to specify the Nen typing’s and what each type is capable of so people can accurately determine what type of Nen an ability should be when raised.
Enhancement – Enhancement of character stats and damage of melee weapons 
Transmutation – Used to change the properties of something
Conjuration – Used to make something
Specialism – Anything that isn’t covered by another type
Manipulation – Used to control objects or people
Emission – Ranged Nen blasts and reinforcement of ranged weapons

#### Scaling

With Specialist abilities and other such complex abilities, it can be much harder to scale but this becomes easier once we have some points of comparison. 
This table details the amount of healing and damage of varying NP and EP cost should be roughly:
|Cost (NP)|Heal – 2 EP|Heal – 1 EP|Dmg – 2 EP|Dmg – 1 EP|
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
|1	      |1d6-2	  |0  	      |1d6	     |1d6-2     |
|2	      |1d6	      |1	      |2d6	     |1d6       |
|3	      |2d6-2	  |1d6-2	  |3d6	     |2d6-2     |
|4	      |2d6	      |1d6	      |4d6	     |2d6       |
|5	      |3d6-2	  |2d6-2	  |5d6	     |3d6-2     |

Hopefully this is an effective baseline. From here, when making other abilities you can think: “If I were to trade this ability out for pure damage, how much damage would it be worth” and get a rough estimate of the level of the ability based on that.
Nen abilities
Unless otherwise stated, activating an ability generally costs EP and NP but maintaining an ability only costs NP. All abilities will have this EP cost listed alongside them. Unless otherwise stated, any Nen ability with a duration can be cancelled at any point on a player’s turn for no cost.
Nen abilities are (typically) split into five levels, with each level having a corresponding cost. Using this in tandem with Nen type classification, we can create a table that should better allow us to understand Nen abilities in the context of the game.
A cost any greater than 5 NP, whilst possible, would likely be unsustainable in combat given each character’s limited NP but this shouldn’t stop you from considering it for your game. Provided the team works to redistribute NP effectively and characters are sufficiently trained, having one player with a cannon 10 NP cost attack could be very cool, I’m sure. The five levels is simply a guideline based on the amount of NP a character can be expected to have throughout the game.
When creating Nen abilities then, we can use this table to outline what types of abilities are available to the character. Let us look at a Transmuter for example: 

|Nen curve|
|Level|Type, Multiplier & NAP/NP Cost|
|	ENH	TRA	CON	SPE	MAN	EMI
|	1.5	1	1.5	Inf	2.5	2
|1	2	1	2	#######	3	2
|2	3	2	3	#######	5	4
|3	5	3	5	#######	8	6
|4	6	4	6	#######	10	8
|5	8	5	8	#######	13	10

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Layer 1</th>
            <th>Layer 2</th>
            <th>Layer 3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=4>L1 Name</td>
            <td rowspan=2>L2 Name A</td>
            <td>L3 Name A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>L3 Name B</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>L2 Name B</td>
            <td>L3 Name C</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>L3 Name D</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note: Specialist abilities can only be learnt by Specialists but otherwise the level of abilities that can be learnt decreases linearly the further you get from the Nen user’s specialty.
This table is formed based on “distance” and “level” as follows:
* Cost of a Nen ability = Ceiling(Level*(1+Distance/2))
* Distance: This is how far the Nen type is from the Nen users’ specialty. For example:
  * Distance between CON and ENH is 2
  * Distance between MAN and MAN is 0
* Level: This is how strong the ability is and (typically) varies from 1-5
* Ceiling: A function, it means to always round up the answer
This table can and has been generalised for characters with Nen focuses that fall between two Nen types and for higher levels of abilities. Provided on the example character sheet is a more comprehensive Nen curve but how much of its functionality is used will be decided by the group playing.
A Transmuter can learn abilities of any kind highlighted in green with difficulty increasing the darker the green. It is equally difficult, for example, for a Transmuter to learn a level 5 Transmuter ability as it is for them to learn a level 2 Manipulator ability (learning either requires you to spend 5 ‘NAPs’, this will be explained momentarily).
Each time your maximum NP increases (usually upon level up, see “Levelling Up”), you gain a number of Nen Ability Points or NAPs. Note: Overcharging does not influence this as it effects your temporary max NP (TMNP, oddly similar to TMNT…) not your MNP.
At any point, once an ability is agreed as fair by the group, you can spend the number of NAPs decided upon to learn that ability. For example, let’s say a Transmuter wishes to learn (what the group has decided is) a Level 2 Conjuration ability, the cost for them to learn this ability (as shown above) is 3. Thus, the Conjurer will spend 3 NAPs and learn the ability. If the party is split between which Nen type the ability should be under then the most convenient for the character is chosen (for example, an ability that could be either EMI or CON will be EMI for an Enhancer but CON for a Transmuter).
Because of the nature of Nen as a system, how you perform your Nen ability is important both for your character to know and to ensure enemies don’t know. As such, alongside each Nen ability, there should be a description of how you can activate it and in what conditions (for example, “Gon collects his Nen into his right fist for a period proportional to the damage output and then punches with the same fist” when he uses his Rock – this is also a good example of how the “Delay” action might be used in an ability). The more detailed and limited the ability, the lower its cost but the higher the potential for it to backfire if an enemy finds out the conditions.

#### Generic Nen abilities

Here, I will provide basic forms of these abilities as well as scaling based on improvements, Nen ability improvements will be explained in “Improving Nen abilities”.
Ten – Level 1 Typeless. Allows you to release and maintain Nen around the body. This must be learnt before any other ability other than Specialist abilities. 
* Base: This ability costs 0 EP to activate and improves every primary stat by 1 and increases combat speed by 5 feet (1 space) for the duration. This ability activates for 1 minute
* Improvements: Improving this ability makes it a Level 0, typeless ability which is constantly active unless you activate Zetsu. Upon activating Zetsu, you lose the benefits of Ten. Upon deactivating Zetsu, Ten automatically reactivates without any action cost
Zetsu – Level 1 Typeless. Shut off the release of Nen, preventing detection from En. 
* Base: This ability costs 1 EP to activate and prevents detection from En for the duration. This ability activates until it is deactivated as a free action. This ability prevents detection no matter the strength of the enemy’s En but, unless otherwise stated, you cannot use any other Nen abilities whilst Zetsu is active. Whilst Zetsu is active, you take extra damage from Nen attacks as you would if you were a non-Nen user
* Improvements: This ability can’t be improved
Ren – Level 2 Enhancement or Emission. Bolsters the release of Nen.
* Base: This ability costs 2 EP to activate. For the duration, any attacks or healing abilities using Enhancement or Emission abilities gain an additional +1 per dice role. This ability remains active for 1 turn (6 seconds), ending at the end of your next turn (if you delay your turn, this ability still ends) unless you spend an additional 1 Nen to keep the ability active (this requires no action cost)
* Improvements: For every improvement, you gain an additional +1 per dice role
Gyo – Level 2 Typeless. Ability to see Nen when activated.
* Base: This ability costs 1 EP to activate. For the duration, you can see any Nen active within sight range unless the Nen user has In active at a higher level. This ability remains active until disabled or until 2 rounds have passed (it ends at the beginning of your turn). Paying additional NP to activate this ability allows you to see better hidden In (paying 3 NP allows you to see In which is hidden with 2 NP per round).
* Improvements: Each time this ability is improved, it lasts 1 additional round. 
In – Level 1 Typeless. Ability to hide Nen when activated. You must know this ability prior to any ability with an In level
* Base: This ability costs 1 EP to activate. Base En cannot detect your passive Nen for the duration. This ability lasts until it is de-activated. Until the ability is deactivated, keeping In active takes 1 NP each round (this is paid at the start of each of your turns unless you disable it at the start of that turn). You can pay additional NP per round to hide your Nen better (paying 2 NP / round hides Nen from Gyo and En activated with 2 NP)
* Improvements: Certain abilities will have In levels; these abilities can’t be activated unless the user has In active at the corresponding level or higher. Improving this ability unlocks abilities with higher In levels. Having In active at higher levels also defends against levels of En and Gyo (En and Gyo +2 cannot detect or see In +3 but can detect and see In +2)
En – Level 1 Typeless. Ability to detect Nen over a certain radius when activated
* Base: This ability costs 1 EP to activate. For the duration, you can detect all Nen users and active Nen in the radius (you do not necessarily understand what the Nen does), unless the Nen user has Zetsu active or has In active at a higher level than your En. You have advantage on any rolls to hit an enemy within your En. This ability doesn’t provide you any information about the Nen user or the Nen they have active other than their location and their level. The ability covers a radius of 30 feet and lasts for 30 seconds. Paying additional NP to activate this ability allows you to sense better hidden In (paying 3 NP allows you to see In which is hidden with 2 NP per round).
* Improvements: Each time you improve this ability; you can choose to double either the radius or the time duration. 
Shu – Level 1 Typeless. Imbue objects with Nen. This ability must be learnt before any other Manipulation ability
* Base: This ability is activated at no cost (both to EP and NP) each time you use a Manipulation ability. Time duration and effects of the manipulation are determined by the manipulation ability activated.
* Improvements: This ability cannot be improved
Ko, Ken & Ryu – Level 1 Enhancement. Concentrate Nen to bolster attacks
* Base: This ability costs 1 EP to activate. This ability lasts until it is deactivated as a free action but requires an additional NP each turn it remains active (paid each time you end a turn without deactivating the ability). Whilst this ability is active, you gain 1 Ryu point. Ryu points can be distributed and redistributed each turn (as a free action) into Ko and Ken however you wish:
  * Ko: A Ryu point in Ko gives you a +1 to all Strength (Attack) or Dexterity (Attack) rolls you make.
  * Ken: A Ryu point in Ken gives you +1 to all Strength (Block) or Dexterity (Dodge) rolls you make. 
* Improvement: Each time you improve this ability; the cost of activation increases by 1 and you gain 1 additional Ryu point for the duration. The amount of NP required to keep the ability active is the activation cost / 2 rounded up.
Sakki – Level 2 Typeless. Nen enhanced intimidation.
* Base: This ability costs 2 EP to activate. For the duration, any character of level less or equal to your level -3 in the radius is unable to fight and will run away if capable, even if they leave the effective range. This ability lasts for 6 seconds (1 round) and ends at the start of your next turn. If you delay your turn, the ability still ends. The radius of the ability is 10 feet or 2 spaces
* Improvements: Each time you enhance the ability you can double the duration or the radius. Alternatively, you can improve the ability twice to increase the level cap by 1 level
These abilities provide the character a basic understanding of Nen manipulation and, as such, must be learnt prior to learning any Hatsu that rely on them (as detailed above). The GM may also decide any generic ability is a prerequisite for certain Hatsu (at their discretion).
Any typeless ability is treated as though it is of the type most expedient for the Nen user (Ten is an ENH ability for an Enhancer but a TRA ability for a Transmuter). More generally, if an ability has multiple potential types, characters learn it in the discipline that is easiest for them (as described previously). If both types are equally expedient for a character (for example, an ENH and a CON ability are equally difficult to learn for a Transmuter) then the player still must choose which type the ability will be as this could potentially change interactions with other abilities.

#### Hybrid Nen abilities

Some more advanced Nen abilities may require the use of multiple types of Nen to work, in cases like these, determining the cost of the ability becomes less simple. The following process explains how to determine cost in these cases:
* Isolate exactly which Nen types are involved, this must be agreed upon by the group
* Calculate the average distance between the Nen types involved and the players focus Nen type 
* Determine a level for the ability
* Then calculate as normal using the average distance

#### Overpowered abilities

One important thing to remember is that the game is meant to be enjoyed by both the entire party and the GM. Whilst it can be fun to deliberately leave loop holes in your abilities that other players don’t notice at the time (thus leading to over powered abilities), if the group decides that your ability is breaking the game, you should be prepared to rid yourself of it for something more balanced at any time. This goes for the GM too: you won’t run your decisions for Nen abilities by your players because it would ruin the spirit of the game, this gives you immense sway over how the players feel playing the game. As such, if an ability is clearly negatively impacting the game, it’s better to drop a few extra hints or scale it back a bit than to blame your players for not putting the pieces together.

#### Altering Nen abilities

##### Improving Nen abilities

We’ve seen throughout the series that many characters are capable of generic Nen abilities that far outstrip those of others; as such, I’d like characters to be able to treat these generic Nen abilities as scalable given they spend the necessary NAPs to unlock higher tiers. I see no reason why this couldn’t also be done for Hatsu (non-generic Nen abilities) either and think the following is reasonable:
* At any time, you can spend 2 NAPs to increase the effectiveness of an ability whilst maintaining the cost (this ability will then become “ability name +1”). For example, a Conjurer can spend 2 NAPs to give their level 4 conjuration ability power on par with a level 5 conjuration ability whilst maintaining a cost of 4 and adding no further restrictions
The idea behind this is that, in using the ability a lot, you have managed to improve your control over the Nen and thus can perform a better version of the ability with the same Nen expenditure. You may still use the base form of the ability when it is expedient. What exactly the enhanced form of the ability is will be discussed by the group but it will typically extend the ability range or damage.

##### Nen Restrictions

Whilst limits upon specific Nen abilities can be put into place upon creating the ability, there may come times where you wish to put a limit upon every action you take or where you want to further limit your abilities than was originally specified. It must be noted that, whilst you may add additional restrictions to an ability or overarching restrictions whenever you please, you cannot remove them (unless stated otherwise).
Any restrictions and their corresponding benefits must be agreed upon by the group as fair and in line with the character.
There are two types of restrictions that can be added:
* Additional restrictions on a specific ability: These restrictions exclusively decrease the cost of the ability; they cannot be used to increase the power of the ability whilst maintaining the same cost. If a restriction of this kind is used post-hoc then you regain any excess NAPs you spent to gain the ability (for example, if extra restrictions reduce a level 3 ability to a level 1 ability, you regain 3 – 1 = 2 NAPs). You can add additional restrictions to a level 1 ability to create a level 0 ability (provided the players and GM agree) which costs no NP to use but you cannot add additional restrictions to a level 0 ability
* Overarching restrictions: These don’t relate to any one ability but rather limit the actions you can take or require a sacrifice of some kind (for example, Gon losing his Nen). In return, all your abilities both current and future (for as long as the restriction is in place) are boosted whilst maintaining the same level

#### Overcharging

You may overcharge your Nen, this allows you to temporarily decrease your NP past 0 into the negatives at a cost:
* For every 1 NP you use past 0, you also lose 1 HP
* For every 5 NP you use past 0, your maximum NP will be temporarily reduced by 1 (this can be recovered by resting as described in “Rest”)
* If your temporary max NP reaches 0 or is negative, you lose your ability to use Nen until your temporary max NP increases past 0 again

### Professions

Whilst there is no intelligence or charisma-based stats in the game directly, it’s useful to have an idea as to the gearing of your characters knowledge and social base to better quell arguments that may occur over these topics. The solution to this will be the Professions system as follows:
* Assuming a level 1 start, each character will be able to choose 2 professions (the GM will decide whether to start with more professions in higher level games)
* These professions will include a title and a short backstory as to how the character acquired that title and can be practically anything if it fits with your character and is accepted by the group
* A GM can hand out professions as a reward for particularly compelling role play or particularly high-level deductions during gameplay or they can be earned during time skips
Professions come with a wealth of knowledge in the field, connections to people in the same and similar fields as well as relevant social skills. In practice, they will be pointed to to justify why your character should be capable of something in a social encounter or why they should know a fact. This makes these otherwise highly interpretation based, and debatable topics clearer cut without simplifying to the extent that all nuance is lost.
A good guideline for GMs is that they should never let their players feel cheated out of a use for their profession:
* A Conman might not be able to convince someone to hand over their life savings, but they can get away with a lot more socially and people tend to be more amenable to their leading questions
* A Field Biologist might not know about a specific plant that lies outside of their field of research but, if they can get to a computer, they might have contacts who can at least narrow it down
The idea being that a profession is almost never perfect, but it is always helpful.
A profession may also aid your character in a more concrete way if the group agree. For example, a Cross Country Runner might have a higher travel speed.

### Status Effects

Bleeding – Bleeding typically results from poisoned weapons or from loss of limb. You will lose a certain amount of HP each time you take a turn for the duration of the encounter or until you are sufficiently healed. Delaying your turns will delay any blood loss.
* If inflicted by poison: HP loss / turn is provided with the weapon
* If inflicted by loss of limb: HP loss / turn is half the max health of that limb
Boxed in – A character is considered boxed in if they are directly between two enemies or if they are surrounded by 3 walls and an enemy. If boxed in, a character cannot dodge
Downed (Lethal) – Whilst in lethal combat, if your HP is negative, you are considered downed. When downed, you cannot stand (and are thus Prone), you cannot use encumbering weapons, but you can still use Nen. When downed, any attack you receive will kill you but any healing you receive will heal you to a minimum of 0 HP and heal the downed condition.
Downed (Non-Lethal) – Whilst in non-lethal combat, if your HP is negative, you will be treated as though your HP is 0. You may still act as normal but doing so will likely go against the rules of the non-lethal combat. If non-lethal combat becomes lethal combat or if non-lethal combat ends ion any other way, you will automatically heal to 50% of max HP.
Encumbered – Encumbered is typically inflicted by especially heavy weaponry, armour and other such items. Whilst this item is on your person, your movement during encounters is halved. You also have -2 to all stealth rolls whilst encumbered.
Frightened: A character may choose to be frightened, or it may be inflicted upon them by an enemy / event. Whilst frightened, a character cannot attack any character, improvise weapons or move closer to the source of their fear unless necessary to retain their life. Whilst frightened, characters are uncommitted. When the frightened condition ends, characters choose whether they are committed or uncommitted based upon their characters current goal
Grappled – Whilst grappled you must make a Grappling contest with your grappler each turn until successful, after which you are no longer grappled. Whilst grappled, you cannot use heavy or very heavy weapons, and you cannot move from the space you currently occupy of your own accord. Depending on the exact method of the grapple, you may be incapable of using specific Nen abilities
Grappling – Whilst grappling someone, you cannot attempt to grapple another character unless otherwise stated. You cannot use heavy or very heavy weapons. Your movement speed is halved, and the grappled character moves with you when you move. You can release a grapple on any turn as a sub-action. Whilst grappling you may occupy the same space as any enemy you are grappling, even if this would usually exceed the limit of that space. Once grappling a character, you can roll to grapple them again as an action; doing so successfully will make them prone and, thus, pinned. Any attacks against a creature you are grappling hit without having to pass a contest
Hidden – Receiving or giving aid or items to another character or changing your environment automatically ends the “hidden” status if within a characters perception radius. You cannot dash whilst hidden. See “Hidden” for more information on this effect
Overcharged – Using too much Nen has left you weakened, your Temporary Max Nen Points (TMNP) is now lower than your actual max. Each time you rest, your TMNP will increase by 1 until it once again equals your actual max NP.
Pinned – A character is pinned if they are both grappled and prone
Poorly rested – You become “poorly rested” after 24 hours without a stationary rest encounter (this includes rests taken inside moving vehicles) of at least 6 hours. Whilst poorly rested, you can no longer rest whilst walking or whilst travelling atop an animal, and you have a -1 modifier to all contests.
Prone – Whilst prone, your movement is halved, you cannot use encumbering weapons, and you have a -2 to Strength (Block) and Dexterity (Dodge) rolls in contests against melee attacks but a +2 to stealth contests.
Reeling – A character is considered reeling after being successfully thrown or after hit by an ability that inflicts reeling. A character automatically recovers from reeling at the start of their next turn. Whilst reeling, a character cannot block and cannot use reactions
Surprised – Whilst your character is surprised, you cannot use actions, sub-actions, free actions or reactions. You naturally recover from surprise at the end of your first turn in combat. Your character is surprised if a combat encounter begins and none of the following conditions aren’t met:
1.	You are immune to the surprised condition
2.	You started combat
3.	You can reasonably argue you knew combat would start
4.	You had an attack prepared even though you didn’t know combat would start
a.	In this final case, the only action you can make before the end of your first turn in combat is the one you had prepared
Terrified – Characters can become terrified of an enemy if they are repeatedly bested in combat or repeatedly forced out of combat by becoming frightened. Terrified characters cannot attack or approach the cause of their fear until the condition is lifted. Characters may also be terrified of an event, a place, an object or anything else (even things that don’t exist). Characters can relieve this condition if the players agree; it will usually require a character moment to be relieved. Certain campaigns may start with characters being “terrified” of certain things and people in their backstory.
Well Rested – Whilst well rested, you have a +1 to all contests.

## Character Creation & Levelling Up

### Levelling Up

Each time you level up you get 5 Level Up Points (LUPs) which can be spent as follows:
* 1 LUP – Increase max HP by 5 
* 1 LUP – Increase max NP by 2 and gain 1 NAP (can only be chosen after unlocking Nen) 
* 1 LUP – Gain two specialties of your choosing
* 2 LUP – Increase one of your primary stats by 1
You’ll notice that this levelling system provides for characters to scale infinitely, whilst this is possible, there will likely be a maximum level characters can reach before managing so many abilities becomes incredibly taxing on both the GM and on the party. Similarly, there will likely be a lower limit to what is fun to play (before a certain point characters will have so few abilities and stats so low that some tasks are completely impossible). This optimum level range will be found during play testing and then added here as a guideline.

### Character Creation

When creating your character, you have a base of:
* 1 in all three primary stats
* 10 HP
* 0 NP
* 3 specialties (of the player’s choice)
You also have 5 + 5x LUP’s to spend as you would normally where x is the start level of your character.

## Encounters

### Types of encounters

Every game session will be a series of encounters some of which will likely run in parallel (two characters may be in a contest of strength whilst two others discuss). These encounters will, broadly, fall into the following types:

#### Contest

A contest is any non-dialogue focussed competition. It will typically be resolved within 1 turn and usually occurs between two characters during a larger encounter. 
A contest check consists of the following:
* Each character rolls 2d6 and adds the modifier relevant to the contest (decided by the GM but usually intuitive), the higher roll either wins or comes closer to winning depending on the number of successful checks to win (once more determined by the GM)
* If a contest ever results in a tied roll, reroll until one character rolls higher
* Contests during combat will resolve in a single roll (plus necessary rerolls) whereas contests outside of combat may take a few rolls
An example of a contest is, during a combat encounter, one character attempts to grapple another, they both roll 2d6 + Strength (Grapple) and, if the attacker rolls highest, the attacked is now Grappled.
A check to perform a specific action, even when another character isn’t involved, can also be seen as a contest. For example, attempting to pick a lock is a contest where the lock constantly rolls the same number (here, the lock essentially has a passive difficulty making it a hybrid between the normal contest as described above and the passive contest as described in Hidden). This form of contest is, thus, ‘semi-passive’ but will be referred to as a skill check.

##### Advantage

For any number of reasons, a GM might believe that a character has a better or worse chance of succeeding in a contest than they usually would (for example, a character who has successfully intimidated or taunted their opponent might have a better chance in an arm wrestle). In cases such as these, the GM can give that character advantage or disadvantage as they see fit on the contest as described below:
* Advantage: Throw 3d6 and take the highest 2 rolls
* Disadvantage: Throw 3d6 and take the lowest 2 rolls
* Double advantage: throw 4d6 and take the highest 2 rolls
This can be extrapolated for any number of advantages or disadvantages though triple will typically be the highest any game has to deal with (see “Targeting”).

|Roll type	        |Average roll   |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Triple advantage	|10.12  (+3.12) |
|Double advantage	|9.34   (+2.34) |
|Advantage	        |8.46   (+1.46) |
|Normal	            |7              |
|Disadvantage	    |5.54   (- 1.46)|
|Double disadvantage|4.66   (- 2.34)|
|Triple disadvantage|3.88   (- 3.12)|

You may stack advantage and disadvantage as much as the rules and abilities in effect allow you to. In the case that a character has both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel as though they were each other’s negatives (for example, double disadvantage + advantage = disadvantage).

##### Partial and Easy Successes

My experience with systems that involve partial successes and failures is somewhat limited and, as such, I’m writing this with the intention for critique and review to fix a lot of the issues. As such, instead of creating a very detailed system for how partial successes and failures will work, I’m instead going to write out a very simple process that is highly up to GM interpretation but also incredibly easy to apply to any situation that involves a check or contest.
When a character competes with another character or attempts to do something that doesn’t have rules explicitly outlined for, they will roll 2d6 and add any modifiers the GM decides upon. Let us pretend, for a second, that the roll that any competing character makes is, instead, a fixed, predetermined value. We can then say that the “difficulty” of this check or contest is x where x is the number that the player needs to roll to succeed. Let’s call the number that the character rolls y. Allow me to then propose the following:
* y < x – 2: The character “completely fails”
* x – 2 <= y < x: The character “partially succeeds”
* x <= y <= x + 2: The character completes exactly what they set out to do
* x + 2 < y: The character “easily succeeds”
A complete failure means that the character isn’t even close to succeeding:
* Attempting to break down a door will result in no change
* Attempting to pick a lock will result in no change
* Attempting to find clues will result in no clues
A partial success is then exactly as described, for example:
* Attempting to break down a door might weaken the wood, lowering the difficulty on a second attempt
* In attempting to pick a lock, you might succeed but take too long and be noticed
* In attempting to find clues, you might find a partial print
An easy success means the character can do even more than they initially wished for, for example:
* Attempting to break down a door could send it flying across the room
* Attempting to pick a lock could be done so swiftly that you wouldn’t be noticed when you otherwise should
* In attempting to find clues, you spot a glaring piece of evidence
It must be noted that, in the case of an easy success, succeeding by too much could, theoretically, cause adverse effects (that flying door could hit an ally). GMs should not punish a character for a good roll so, if an easy success would cause an adverse effect, allow the player the chance to hold back instead. Also, on an easy success, GMs should attempt to get characters involved, asking them to describe exactly what the effects of their action are rather than deciding alone.

#### Combat

##### Starting and finishing combat

Characters will decide upon entering combat whether they are committed or not based upon their characters current primary goal.
Committed: A character is “committed” in combat if they have a goal that can only be accomplished through the battle. Committed characters cannot leave the combat and have 3 focuses (explained in “Focus”) unless stated otherwise. Committed characters become uncommitted once they have accomplished their goal, if their goal becomes impossible, or if a new goal takes precedence
Uncommitted: A character is “uncommitted” in combat if they have a non-combat focused goal. Uncommitted characters cannot attack unprovoked and have 2 focuses unless stated otherwise. Uncommitted characters may choose to commit at the start of each turn if their primary goal has changed
Combat ends when: 
* All characters are unconscious or uncommitted or, 
* Only 1 character remains in combat
If characters are still frightened when combat ends, they are no longer frightened. This may result in situations where combat would instantly restart. As such, if it can be reasonably expected that, upon a repeat combat, the characters would be frightened again they become “terrified” of their opponent.

##### Initiative and round structure

Deciding initiative:
* Characters are ordered in terms of speed
* Any characters with tied speed roll 2d6 and the highest go first
Combat then continues in 5 second rounds with a three-phase structure:
* Movement phase:
  * Any character that wishes to dash or hide this round will state their intent
  * Players then take turns moving 5 feet (10 feet if dashing) moving down initiative order
    * Any character may choose to delay their movement until after another character
    * If two characters wish to delay after one another then the faster character (or the character that rolls highest on 2d6 if speed is tied) decides who moves first
  * Once everyone is out of movement (or doesn’t wish to move), this phase ends
* Action & reaction phase: 
  * Moving down initiative order, characters decide if they want to act and, if so, what they wish to do
  * At any point, if a “reaction” ability fulfils its activation requirements, a character may activate it
* Downing phase:
  * Any characters that have been reduced to 0 HP over the course of the round are now “downed”
  * Then, any characters that were already downed and received lethal damage this round die in this phase too 

##### Actions

In combat, each character can do four things during each combat round:
* Movement – The character moves up to their allowed maximum in whichever direction/directions they please. Movement can be taken at any point during a turn or can be split up over the course of a turn provided the sum of all movement doesn’t exceed the character’s maximum.
* Actions – Actions cost EP. Each character typically has 4 EP which recycles at the beginning of each round. Here is a list of typical actions and their EP cost:
  * Attack – Cost: Variable. Any attacking ability initiates a contest to see if the attack deals damage. What this contest is between depends upon the ability and the defender. The ability will state what stat and specialty to roll, and the defender may choose whether to roll a Strength (Block) or a Dexterity (Dodge) roll to defend. 
    * A character is unable to block if they are reeling or grappled
    * A character is unable to dodge is they are boxed in or pinned
    * If a character is both unable to block and unable to dodge, attacks hit without the need for a contest
  * Grapple – Cost: 2. As described in “Stats”. When you successfully grapple an enemy, you must state how you grapple them (using a wrestling term or describing a hold etc) as specific holds may make them incapable of using specific Nen abilities whilst grappled
  * Hide – Cost: 2. To hide successfully mid-combat, a character must do all the following:
    * State your intention to hide
    * Break line of sight with an enemy 
    * Move more than 4 spaces (20 feet) from where they were last seen without stepping back into line of sight of an enemy 
    * The character is then hidden from any enemy that the character didn’t step back into the line of sight of 
    * Any enemy that still knows the character’s location may use a speech action to alert his allies on their turn
  * Non-standard movement – Cost: 1. Any form of movement that your character can’t reasonably be expected to have training in (i.e. climbing, swimming)
  * Aid – Cost: 1. This provides another character within touching range advantage on the next roll they make whilst within range. You don’t have to be in touching range if you can reasonably argue you can aid from afar (for example, you may offer advice to an ally).
    * If a character is aided then moves out of range, takes an action or sub-action and then moves back into range and takes another action or sub-action all in one turn, then the second action or sub-action gains advantage
    * If a character doesn’t perform an action or sub-action within range on their next turn, then the aid is wasted
  * Dash – Cost: 1. This sub-action doubles the character’s movement for this turn
  * Shove – Cost: 1. Shoving someone in touching distance results in a Base Strength v Base Strength contest to see if the shove is successful. If the shove succeeds, the character is “reeling” until the beginning of their next turn. If they delay their turn, they still stop reeling at the usual time
  * Switch weapon – Cost: 1. The player switches between their active weapon and another that they have on their person.
  * Stand or crouch – Cost: 1. Used to enter or exit the prone condition
  * Pass – Cost: 1. A character may hand an item on their person to another character provided they each have a free hand, and they are within touching range. Accepting this item uses a reaction. 
    * If the other character doesn’t accept the item, the item is dropped and may be picked up by any character in touching range using a sub-action 
    * If a character is passed something then moves out of range and back into range within one turn, they may still accept the item if they have a sub-action to spend. 
    * If character 1 is handed an item from character 2 but delays their turn until after character 2’s next turn, then the item is dropped.
    * If the item is expendable and requires a sub-action to use then the item can be both picked up or accepted and used with the same sub-action (for example, a lit grenade can be both accepted and thrown at the cost of one sub-action)
  * Improvised weapons and changing environs will be covered in the chapter of the same title
  * Normal movement – Cost: 0. You move up to your combat speed in distance this round.
* Reactions – These are abilities that can be activated at any point in combat rather than purely on your turn. Reactions do not cost EP (unless otherwise stated) and there is no upper limit to how many reactions can be used in one round. An ability can only be used on your turn unless stated otherwise
  * Speaking – The character is allowed to make short quips throughout combat, this can be used to disarm or confuse an opponent, to negotiate surrender / the end of combat or to strategize with allies. All characters within normal hearing range hear what a character says
  * Shouting – This follows the same rules as speaking but can be heard by any character within their extended hearing range
  * Whispering – This follows the same rules as speaking but can only be heard by characters within 5 feet (1 space)
* Disabling abilities – Unless stated otherwise, disabling an ability costs no NP or EP and can be done at any point during your turn
Some abilities may have a cool down or wind up necessary to activate their full ability:
* Cool-down: If an attack with a cool-down is used, the character will have less energy with which to act next turn and potentially the turn after that. This could vary dependent upon the ability and will thus be stated on all cool-down abilities
* Wind-up: Attacks with a wind-up will be used on one round but resolved on another. One any interim rounds, the character acts as though they have no energy and does nothing (gaining the defending status unless otherwise stated)
If an ability is neither cool-down nor wind-up, it will almost always resolve on the same turn that it is activated.
Whilst in combat, it’s imperative not only to know your exact spacing but what actions are taken and at what time as this can have massive effects on Nen abilities that could result in long discussions mid encounter if timing isn’t incredibly clear. As such, as opposed to a typical round based initiative system, combat will proceed as follows:
If a character is surprised, they don’t take a turn in combat in the first round of combat

##### Improvised Weapons and Changing Environs

Improvised weapons and changing environs are naturally incredibly situationally dependant actions and, thus, will probably be considered on a case-by-case basis when evaluating damage done, EP used and the like. That said, a simple framework is useful to have and helps to promote more creative actions (by making outcomes less variable).
To draw a clearer distinction between the two:
* Improvising a weapon is about hitting your enemy
* Changing your environs is about stopping, slowing or escaping your enemy
It should be noted that, whilst the rules we outline in this document do attempt to promote the use of creative thinking during encounters, characters can only be as creative as their GM allows them to be. Giving varying levels of detail prior to an encounter or simply never accurately describing the scene will frustrate any attempts characters make at improvising weapons and changing their environment. As such GMs should endeavour to vary each important encounter and to always provide sufficient information about the scene.

###### Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is anything in your environment that, whilst its primary purpose isn’t as a method of attack, can easily be turned into a weapon. This could be anything between a smashed bottle and a section of a wall if a character is strong enough.
Effort cost for improvised weapons works the same as normal weapons:
* Light weapons typically cost 1 EP to use
* Heavy weapons typically cost 2 EP to use
* Very heavy weapons typically cost 3 EP to use
* Extremely heavy weapons typically cost 4 EP to use
Your GM will specify upon being questioned how much EP an improvised weapon will use as creating the weapon can also be difficult and may result in additional EP costs, but this is at their discretion.
How much damage an improvised weapon does should also follow the general pattern for normal weapons:
* Light weapons – 1d6
* Heavy weapons – 2d6
* Very heavy weapons – 3d6
* Extremely heavy weapons – 4d6
This is prior to any modifiers or abilities that will undoubtedly affect these roles
It should also be noted that some characters may have abilities that change the modifiers or number of dice involved in damage calculation and to hit rolls. Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that these alterations should carry over, for example:
* One ability might double all damage dealt with any sharp weapon in specific circumstances. This change should obviously count for attacks with a broken glass bottle
* Another ability may increase a characters to hit rolls when using a sword. This should obviously not carry over to throwing a brick at an opponent

###### Changing Environs

Generally, changing your environment will focus on creating, moving or destroying obstacles. It should be noted that, whilst some obstacles in an arena will support others (and thus you need to be wary of affecting them too much), any object on a battle mat should be interactable. This is especially true for Enhancers at higher levels who should be able to move and destroy basically anything you can put in front of them.
Some Nen abilities will be focused explicitly on manipulating the environment and it’s up to players to determine what is fair for those abilities. In this section, we’ll instead be discussing how to determine:
1.	Is it possible for a character to physically perform what they wish to do?
2.	How difficult is it?
3.	What does success and failure look like?
4.	How much energy does it cost?
First, let’s outline the process by which a character manipulates their environment:
1.	They state what they wish to do
2.	Their GM tells them how hard the task will be and what stat / specialty they’ll be rolling
3.	The character then determines how much energy they wish to spend on the action:
a.	It is assumed that the player spends no energy unless otherwise stated
b.	For each EP the character spends, they gain 1 advantage on the roll
4.	The character then rolls their check and, succeeds or fails as described in the “Partial Success and Failures” chapter
This answers questions 3 and 4.
To answer questions 1 and 2, we’ll have to benchmark the difficulty of certain tasks which GMs can use as a basis for decisions in combat. See the following table:
Roll	Challenge	Example
1-4	Easy	Spreading caltrops
5-8	Normal	Tipping a table
9-12	Hard	Throwing a small sofa
13-16	Expert	Breaking through a section of a supporting wall
16-20	Incredible	Stopping a car
21-24	Impossible	Bringing down a house

##### Non-Lethal combat

Prior to combat, characters can decide they wish it to be non-lethal, in these cases combat will automatically end once all of one side is at a predetermined HP %. For the duration of the match, reaching this HP % will “down” a character. In the case that one party decides to employ lethal combat during a contest, the attacking party will gain advantage on their attacks for one round. All other rules in non-lethal combat are as written in typical combat. 
After non-lethal combat, you can choose whether you wish to knock a downed combatant unconscious or not. They cannot prevent this unless stated otherwise. If you knock them unconscious, they will remain that way until you wake them up or until an hour has passed, whichever happens first.

##### Targeting

Because of the nature of Nen as a system, sometimes specific body parts are important in the activation of a Nen ability (for example, Gon’s Rock attack couldn’t be used were he to lose his right arm). This means that targeting body parts for attacks is a viable strategy to shut down an opponent and that this needs to be considered when building the system. 
As such, when declaring an attack, you can decide to take a disadvantage to your “to hit” role and target a specific body part in hopes of separating it from the body or severely damaging it. The disadvantage depends on how specific the attack is, as follows:
* Torso: Disadvantage
* Arm, leg: Double disadvantage
* Hand, foot, head or smaller body part: Triple disadvantage
If the attack hits, that amount of damage will be dealt both to your HP and to that body part. Body part health doesn’t require tracking unless targeted. It is as follows:
* Torso, head: ½ max HP
* Arm, leg: ¼ max HP
* Hand, foot or similar sized body part: 1/8 max HP
* Finger or similar sized body part:1/16 max HP
When a body part falls below half health it is deemed unusable and, thus, any abilities or weapons that rely on its use can no longer be used. If a body part falls to 0 HP, it is separated from the body or mangled beyond the ability for normal abilities to heal. To regain the body part, an ability designed to restore permanent injuries is necessary (this is a very high-cost ability).
An attacker might also choose to attack an object on a character that’s integral to their Nen ability (for example, Chrollo’s book) to knock it from their person. This can be done in two ways:
* Attempt to destroy the object: Objects that are integral to Nen abilities should have a pre-decided HP and reducing that HP to 0 makes the object temporarily unusable (until such a time as it is restored to at least half HP)
* Attempt to make the opponent drop the object: This results in a Strength (Attack) or Dexterity (Attack) v Strength (Block) or Dexterity (Dodge) contest where each character uses the highest modifier. The GM may give advantage or disadvantage based on how difficult it is to drop the object (a small object or one that is taped to the body would be harder to drop) but this is at the GM’s discretion
It should be noted that how you fight throughout a campaign will have large, long-lasting effects on how other characters see you. Always defaulting to maiming tactics and lethal combat (and especially starting non-lethal combat explicitly with the intent to switch to lethal combat and earn a surprise attack) will mean other characters trust you a lot less.
Resorting to lethal combat also makes characters more willing to overcharge as their life is on the line meaning it will typically make combat more dangerous.

##### Streamlining Combat

###### Focus

Unless stated otherwise:
* Committed characters can focus on 3 characters
* Uncommitted characters can focus on 2 characters
If you are focussed on a character, you may:
* Target them with any ability or attack provided the prerequisites are met
* Aid them
* Give them and receive items from them
Whether you are focussed on a character or not:
* You may pick up items they drop
* Any area of effect abilities you have active will still affect them
* You can still attack them with improvised weapons
* They are not immune to any changes you make in the environment
Note: These rules mean the only way to interact with characters you aren’t focusing on is by using improvised weapons and manipulating the environment. This means, in many situations, group combat will necessitate characters to think outside of the box to support their allies.
Unless stated otherwise, the objects and people a Manipulator controls have the same focuses as the manipulator.
You cannot switch your focus unless you are in a situation such that you cannot reasonably interact with a character you are focused on (unless otherwise stated). For example, your focus may be:
* Further away from you than your movement speed
* On the other side of a wall with no nearby way through
* Hidden behind another character with no way around
You may only change a focus character at the beginning of your turn (unless otherwise stated). Changing focus is done at no cost.
Some abilities may forcibly change characters focus or prevent focus from changing.

###### Mob enemies

In large combats, the GM may choose to simplify round initiative calculations by having groups of similar enemies act as though they have one turn between them all, each taking their actions at the same time
* In cases like this, player characters can choose to delay their turn to the same time as this group, resulting in them taking their turn in the middle of that groups actions (for example, two security guards may take their turns simultaneously but player A delays their turn to act after the first but before the second security guard and, therefore, during their joint turn)
Discussion
During discussions, positioning is still important to consider as it determines how the encounter will progress if combat begins but otherwise there are no strict rules to this type of encounter. A character may choose to prepare an attack during discussion to be included in a surprise round if one takes place, but the following must be kept in mind: 
* A character must unprepare their attack to interact with their environment (unless otherwise stated) – this does not include walking unless the attack requires the attacker to be stationary
* A character must regularly (when prompted by the GM based on the context) roll a contest of stealth v relevant perception to ensure other characters don’t realise they have an attack prepared. This will typically be:
  * When an attack is prepared,
  * When a new character enters the encounter and, 
  * At regular intervals if the attack is prepared for a long period
* The GM may decide there are enough people in the encounter that an attack cannot be prepared without being noticed by either the target or an ally of theirs

#### Hidden

##### Hidden Enemies

Whilst hidden, no other character is made aware of your appearance until necessary. As such, player characters can believe that they are in a Contest or a Discussion encounter whilst in a Hidden encounter. In such cases, it is up to the GM to determine how much progress hidden enemies make and what actions they take over time as players aren’t aware that ‘rounds’ are taking place and thus these ‘rounds’ can’t be ran as usual. In such encounters, GMs should make use of “passive contests” using the players perception modifiers and the enemies’ stealth modifiers rather than dice rolls to determine if, when and how player characters notice the enemies; this saves on contests so as not to alert players unnecessarily. In the following cases:
* A player decides to stay on watch for an extended period: Add 1 to their perception modifier for the passive contests
* A player is actively searching their surroundings: Add 2 to their perception modifier for the passive contests
In theory, this would require many repeated ‘passive’ checks as the encounter progresses, but this would be a significant amount of work on the GMs part and would likely alert players to the situation early. In practice, the GM will likely simplify these encounters through the following process:
* Prior to the encounter, work out the situations in which the hidden enemies would be revealed. For example, if the highest passive perception of the player’s party is 5 and the hidden enemies have a passive stealth of 6 then the enemies would be discovered in the following situations:
  * One of the enemies move into line of sight of a player character,
  * One of the enemies is in a player character’s En without having Zetsu active,
  * One of the player characters goes on watch or is otherwise unoccupied for an extended period or,
  * A player character decides to search their surroundings
* Now that the GM knows the conditions in which the hidden enemies would be revealed, they can progress through the encounter allowing the hidden enemies to go about their plans in secret and without any additional work until such a time as they would be discovered. At this point, the GM alerts the players that have discovered the hidden enemies and play continues as normal

##### Hidden Players

In the case that player characters are the ones hiding however, proceed as follows:
To hide successfully mid-combat, a character must do all the following (this is also detailed in “Combat”):
* State your intention to hide
* Break line of sight with an enemy 
* The character is then hidden from any enemy that the character didn’t step back into the line of sight of
* Any enemy that still knows the character’s location may use a speech action to alert his allies on their turn (see “Hiding in non-hidden encounters”)
In a “Hidden Players” encounter (that is to say, an encounter where the enemies aren’t yet aware the players are close by), all players are treated as hidden by default.
To remain hidden, any hiding characters must make a stealth v perception contest each time they: 
* Move into another character’s perception range (this only needs doing when entering a character’s largest perception range unless otherwise stated)
* Start a turn in another character’s perception range
* Make any action or reaction whilst within another character’s perception range that would reasonably cause enough noise or visual disturbance that it could alert them. This is up to GM discretion 
* Making a sufficiently loud noise or moving into direct field of vision can mean being spotted even outside of this range at GM discretion
When rolling a perception check to find a hidden character, roll with the highest of your three perception skills that the character is within range of (if your smell is +2 20 ft, sight +1 30 ft and hearing +0 30 ft and the hidden character is somewhere between 20 and 30 ft away, check using sight).
It should be noted that it takes a speech action for an enemy to alert their allies of your presence and, as such, even if you are noticed by an enemy whilst hiding, you will typically get off an attack on a close enemy before the alarm is raised.
Perception range can be decreased or increased based upon the surrounding light level and other such factors. Your GM will alert you to any of these effects once it comes into effect, but they will not tell you if an enemy has an ability to counteract the effect. Some characters may also have multiple perception ranges based on different senses, once more your GM isn’t obligated to share this information.
When attacking whilst hidden, you can choose either of the following:
* Your attack is guaranteed to hit (and thus skips the contest to hit)
* Your attack, if it hits, deals double damage (roll the same dice and double the total after modifiers)
Attacking an enemy will immediately alert them to your presence (without the need for a contest), meaning that only one attack per enemy can benefit from this.
If another character moves such that they have direct line of sight to a hidden character that character is considered compromised immediately, without any competition.

#### Rest 

Rest encounters will are very simple and, whilst they can span a lot of in game time, they should resolve rather quickly. 
The key mechanic of a rest encounter is the interruption roll. Every action taken during a rest encounter can either increase or decrease the chance of being attacked or interrupted during the encounter. The interruption roll then acts as a check, determining whether the party succeeds in what they set out to do, to what extent and why it is they’re interrupted. If the party is incapable of completing their rest, they may attempt to rest again immediately after so long as they aren’t forced into a different type of encounter. If the party is split up during the encounter, the GM may decide to roll different interruption rolls for each subset or even each player (this is context dependant). 
The interruption check is done as so; roll 1d6 + Privacy modifier + Noise modifier:
* 1-, the rest fails immediately, and no benefits of the actions taken are received
* 2, the rest ends after ¼ the specified time
* 3, the rest ends after ½ the specified time
* 4, the rest ends after ¾ the specified time
* 5+, the full rest occurs
If the situation is supposed to be completely safe or unfathomably dangerous, the GM can (at their discretion) skip the check and state rest is either completed perfectly or is impossible.
The privacy modifier is decided by location summing any of the following modifiers that apply:
* Dangerous area: -2
* Inside a town: -1
* Not in town: +1
* Private room: +2
The noise modifier is determined by the actions taken during the rest. Each rest action has a noise cost (the sum of which is the noise modifier) as detailed below:
* Sleeping/Relaxing – Noise modifier: 0. Whilst sleeping, you regain 1/8 your HP and 1/4 NP every hour. You also regain 1 temporary maximum NP every 4 hours if your TMNP is lower than your max NP
* Keeping watch – Noise modifier: 1. Whilst keeping watch, you regain 1/8 your HP and 1/4 NP every 2 hours 
* Using Nen – Noise modifier: -2. You may use Nen whilst resting without expending any NP, this can be used to shape your environment, heal other people etc. You regain no HP or NP whilst doing this
The interruption to the rest can be anything that makes sense in context; if resting in enemy territory you might be discovered by the enemy, if making too much noise in town, a neighbour might hassle you for it etc.
If you sleep a full 8 hours, you are well rested for the next 16 hours.
For an example encounter: A party of three try to rest in a private room in a town, they are not in enemy territory. They would like to sleep for 6 hours, each taking watch for 2 hours. The GM rolls 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 so each person get 4 hours of sleep and 2 hours keeping watch, meaning each person restores 5/8 of their HP and NP.

#### Travel

Travelling occurs at the travelling speed of the slowest character in the party or the slowest vehicle being used (each character should know their travel and combat speeds, see “Speed”). Travelling can be sped up or slowed down depending on the terrain and some vehicles will be incapable of travel on certain terrains.
If travelling in a vehicle, characters that aren’t driving may treat the encounter as a rest encounter. If travelling atop an animal or on foot, characters may rest if they aren’t “poorly rested” and aren’t being pursued.
Whilst vehicles will individually outline the terrain they can handle, here is a brief outline:
* Field / hill – Basic terrain, most vehicles will be encumbered (1/2 speed), but animals and people will be unaffected
* Shallow water / swamp / forest / sheer cliff – Most vehicles will be incapable of traversing this terrain, animals and people will be encumbered
* Deep water – Only specific vehicles and people with strength exceeding 5 can traverse this terrain
* Road – Perfect terrain

### Shifting between encounter type

Switching into combat (whether lethal or not) requires the consent of only one character, it can start at any point during any other encounter. When switching into a combat encounter, you may be “surprised” in several cases, see “Status Effects” for more information. 
An encounter automatically switches from hidden to another encounter type as soon as a hiding character is discovered or reveals themselves. What the encounter switches to is determined by the characters involved.
Any other switch between encounter type can only occur with the consent of all characters that are both involved and conscious (for example, a combat can cease if both parties decide so and a contest can start if all those involved agree to it etc). In contexts where consent is ambiguous, the GM decides (for example, two player characters may fight over a rope but neither decides to enter a contest, in this case, the GM can force a contest).

## Weapons

Whilst it can be expected that many modifiers and abilities will be at work during any one encounter, the base stats of weapons do need standardising somewhat so that GMs can more easily balance those that become available during the game. In this section, we’ll attempt to create a system for categorising weapons and thus determining their stats.
A weapon will need the following information:
* Base damage
* How much EP they cost to use
* Whether it will use Dexterity, Perception or Strength
* Range / reach
To determine this, we will use the items ‘weight category’ and weapons ‘type’. Weights are given below with an example:
* Light weapons – A dagger
* Heavy weapons – A sword
* Very heavy weapons – A great sword
* Extremely heavy weapons – Anything larger (i.e. a chunk of a wall)
Weapon type is as follows:
* Ranged weapons – Anything you shoot or throw
* Melee weapons – Anything else
All ranged weapons will use Dexterity or Perception (this will typically be the choice of the player, though some weapons may restrict the choice). 
All light melee weapons will use Dexterity.

Range on ranged weapons heavily depends upon the weapon and will be decided case by case.
Strength restriction: This is the minimum strength required to wield a weapon successfully

### Very Heavy Weapons

Unless otherwise stated, characters need both hands free to use a very heavy or extremely heavy weapon.
Very and extremely heavy melee weapons will also typically be capable of hitting multiple targets with one hit provided they are sufficiently closer together. Unless otherwise stated, every very and extremely heavy melee weapon has the following abilities rather than a normal attack ability:
* Sweep: The range of the attack is decreased by 5 feet but will hit any enemies in a 90-degree radius (on hexagonal and square grids, this means three connected squares)
  * On a square grid, this means a very heavy weapon will hit 2 spaces and an extremely heavy weapon will hit 5
  * On a hexagonal grid, this means a very heavy weapon will hit 2 spaces and an extremely heavy weapon will hit 6
* Slam: The weapon is swung overhead, slamming down on a line of enemies radiating out from the player
These abilities cost 3 EP for a very heavy weapon or 4 EP for an extremely heavy weapon unless stated otherwise.
In cases where a very or extremely heavy weapon ability hits two or more spaces that are both occupied by the same creature, the creature rolls to dodge with disadvantage and, if hit, the damage dealt increases proportional to the number of spaces hit (i.e. if a creature takes up 3 spaces that are hit by an attack, the creature rolls to dodge with disadvantage and, if hit, takes triple damage).
Unless otherwise stated, characters carrying very or extremely heavy weapons cannot hide and are encumbered unless their strength exceeds the weapon’s strength restriction by 2 or more.
Very and extremely heavy ranged weapons pierce through a target if the target’s block roll fails by 5 or more, resulting in potential additional hits as described in “Loose Shots”. Such wounds also inflict bleeding equal to the amount the character failed by / 2 but only if a character is pierced (unless otherwise stated). A very heavy weapon can only pierce 1 opponent; an extremely heavy weapon can pierce 2.
In cases where a ranged weapon would pierce a creature that takes up multiple spaces and 2 or more are in the line of fire, the creature is automatically hit again. 

### Loose Shots

In the case that a ranged weapon or ability is dodged by an opponent or ally, but others could theoretically be hit by it (they are both within range of the ability and would be hit were the other character not in the way), those characters will roll to dodge or block. The attacking character will not reroll to hit meaning the second character will be rolling to dodge against the initial “to hit” roll.
This makes positioning incredibly important when playing with ranged characters for example:
* Lining up allies for a round could allow for a penetrative healing ability
* Lining up two dexterity focused enemies means you get two attempts to hit
* One ally can choose to dodge your healing ability if another ally in range needs it more

## Time Skips

Each character will decide what they wish to do with their time skip and their GM will decide what is possible in the time. This may include any number of level ups, professions or point redistributions and even swapping out of Nen abilities provided enough time passes, this is all up to GM discretion.
