You’re looking at the end now, <br>
And it’s still so far away. <br>
But it always looks so lonely there, <br>
Why is nobody there, <br>
But you?

You’re looking behind you now, <br>
At things you can never change. <br>
If only you could’ve been not you, <br>
But if “not you”, then who?

You’re looking at yourself now, <br>
The one who’s never good enough, <br>
The one with the excuses. <br>
What use is, <br>
He?

You’re looking at your friends now <br>
No flaws or struggles of their own. <br>
I wonder how can you believe that? <br>
**Do** you, believe that?

Or are you just so wrapped up in yourself, <br>
You’re too blind to truly see anybody else?

So you never have a thought for **now**, <br>
Never a thought for **how**, <br>
Those people experience things, <br>
Besides you.

Because it’s only you that **you** see, <br>
At the end.
