You’re looking at the end now,

And it’s still so far away.

But it always looks so lonely there,

Why is nobody there,

But you?


You’re looking behind you now,

At things you can never change.

If only you could’ve been not you,

But if “not you”, then who?


You’re looking at yourself now, 

The one who’s never good enough,

The one with the excuses.

What use is,

He?


You’re looking at your friends now

No flaws or struggles of their own.

I wonder how can you believe that?

**Do** you, believe that?


Or are you just so wrapped up in yourself,

You’re too blind to truly see anybody else?


So you never have a thought for **now**,

Never a thought for **how**,

Those people experience things,

Besides you.


Because it’s only you that **you** see,

At the end.
