The phone grew heavy in his hand, threatening to drop from his grip, from the cliff, into that endless expanse below. He couldn’t even see the floor from here; no matter where he looked, it was all the same murky black abyss. At least if he looked up there were stars, dots of light, of something piercing through all of that nothing. Down there… It was just empty.

“Adam?” Adessa’s voice called tentatively from behind him. His time alone was up so quickly. “What did he say?”

The darkness was swirling and writhing and pressing in on him from all directions, keeping him from speaking, from moving. He could imagine the face Adessa was making, what she was feeling on his behalf, he just needed a moment before responding.

“He gave his phone to someone else, left them a message for me.”  She frowned and closed the distance slightly, hovering just a few feet away from the edge. The whole world was silent for a moment, the nothingness surrounding them absorbing even the usual ambient noises of nature. Adessa was waiting.

“‘Says he was having too much fun and wanted to keep moving.”

“We’re only a day behind schedule, is that really too much to ask?” Perhaps she thought she was doing Adam a favour by being angry on his behalf, but he waved the question aside.

“He was never going to answer, whether we got here on time or not.” 

“You do know this could be your last chance to talk with him, right? Why are you acting like this is fine?” She paused before trying again, her voice calmer. “If you knew he wouldn’t pick up then why even bother calling?”

“He told me what he needed to, Adessa.” She caught herself, forcing her retort back down her throat, using it to smother her rising anger. There was something frustrating in his voice she couldn’t place. Relief?

“…I just, I don’t get why you’re okay with this.” For a moment, Adam didn’t respond, and she could feel her nails biting into her skin. “I thought you loved him?”

“The person I love isn’t capable of picking up that call. So, I’m glad he didn’t, even if I don’t get to speak to him again.” Adam lay back on the grass and patted the space next to him. “Lie down Adessa, you’re missing the night.”

She bit her lip and considered leaving for a moment, but he looked so peaceful for once, just lying there. There was a short silence as they watched the sky together; neither knew anything about space but the stars were prettier that way.



“Did you know there aren’t any in the north? … Stars, I mean.” Adessa turned to frown at him but couldn’t work out if he was joking. 

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I’m not, he told me last time. He says he hasn’t seen a single one since he left.” She was readying a retort, but Adam continued, “it’s not because of the clouds. He says he hasn’t seen those in a while either.”

“Then how does he travel at night?”

“So, apparently, the northerners make lots of small lights and they spread them around the roads and cities so you can see like its day. He says, when you look down from really high up, it’s like you’re looking at the stars.”

“Stars on the ground? He could tell you the grass’s blue in the north and you’d believe him Adam.” Adam rolled his eyes at her and turned back to the sky.

“… Don’t you think it’s nice though?” The dots of light shifted and flickered above him, riding the waves of that black abyss. 


“If there weren’t any stars, people would make them.”
