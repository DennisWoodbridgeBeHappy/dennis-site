He lays himself out on the kitchen floor,
Looking over old history,
He looks different each time,
How different is he really?

There’s pieces missing he realises,
And yet no gaps left to fill,
What could he be missing,
What did he choose to kill?

He seems so much bigger now,
Across the floor, his pieces sprawl,
Where did the new ones come from,
Was he really ever that small?

Day upon day, year upon year,
He’s never the same as he was before,
How long until he can no longer fit,
On the kitchen floor?
