He lays himself out on the kitchen floor, <br>
Looking over old history, <br>
He looks different each time, <br>
How different is he really?

There’s pieces missing he realises, <br>
And yet no gaps left to fill, <br>
What could he be missing, <br>
What did he choose to kill?

He seems so much bigger now, <br>
Across the floor, his pieces sprawl, <br>
Where did the new ones come from, <br>
Was he really ever that small?

Day upon day, year upon year, <br>
He’s never the same as he was before, <br>
How long until he can no longer fit, <br>
On the kitchen floor?
