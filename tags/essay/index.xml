Valkyrie is likely the most consistent main character throughout the series (as long as you separate her from her two alter egos, Stephanie and Darquesse), she’s:
Self absorbed
Hypocritical
Obsessed with Skulduggery
And she never thinks too far ahead
That said, she understands good and evil enough to, on a scale larger than her personal life, choose the correct side.</description></item><item><title>Zombies are so fucking cool man, you just don't get it</title><link>/dennis-site/posts/zombiesessay/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dennis-site/posts/zombiesessay/</guid><description>Minor spoilers ahead for: The Walking Dead, The Stuff, I Am Legend, One Punch Man
