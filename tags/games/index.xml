It will need to outline rules for:
Creating player, non-player characters and animals Social interactions, fights, rests and travel Tools and human on object interactions Character progression and training Nen abilities (including Nen beasts) Basic scaling for weapons and abilities The goal is not to create a system that explains everything in hxh, for example I will not aim to incorporate Killuaâ€™s assassin skills into the system.</description></item></channel></rss>
