Misbegotten, I pour beer,
Can I leave yet? No.</description></item><item><title>All Alone At The End</title><link>/dennis-site/posts/attheend/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dennis-site/posts/attheend/</guid><description>You’re looking at the end now,
And it’s still so far away.
But it always looks so lonely there,
Why is nobody there,
But you?
You’re looking behind you now,
At things you can never change.
If only you could’ve been not you,
But if “not you”, then who?
You’re looking at yourself now,
The one who’s never good enough,
The one with the excuses.
What use is,
He?
You’re looking at your friends now</description></item><item><title>An Endless Jigsaw</title><link>/dennis-site/posts/endlessjigsaw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dennis-site/posts/endlessjigsaw/</guid><description>He lays himself out on the kitchen floor,
Looking over old history,
He looks different each time,
How different is he really?
There’s pieces missing he realises,
And yet no gaps left to fill,
What could he be missing,
What did he choose to kill?
He seems so much bigger now,
Across the floor, his pieces sprawl,
Where did the new ones come from,
Was he really ever that small?</description></item></channel></rss>
