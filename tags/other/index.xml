It will need to outline rules for:
Creating player, non-player characters and animals Social interactions, fights, rests and travel Tools and human on object interactions Character progression and training Nen abilities (including Nen beasts) Basic scaling for weapons and abilities The goal is not to create a system that explains everything in hxh, for example I will not aim to incorporate Killuaâ€™s assassin skills into the system.</description></item><item><title>Project 1: Setting up the website</title><link>/dennis-site/posts/setup-helloworld/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dennis-site/posts/setup-helloworld/</guid><description> Get the website made and hosted locally: Done Get the website up on Git: Done Create a list of backdated projects to post: Done Learn how to post images and videos: Done Work out how to tag posts: Done Website fully set up :smile:</description></item></channel></rss>
